#### 4.01.3 Continuous-Action Environments with Partial Randomness

In exploring continuous-action tasks under partial randomness, it is essential to identify scenarios that capture both the high-dimensional control challenges and the unpredictability that arises from noise or stochastic transitions. Here, we propose representative environments that reflect these conditions in a scalable and instructive manner.
