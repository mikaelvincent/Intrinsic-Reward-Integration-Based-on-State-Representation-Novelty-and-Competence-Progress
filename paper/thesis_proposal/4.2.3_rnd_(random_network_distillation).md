#### 4.2.3 RND (Random Network Distillation)

RND (Burda et al., 2018) consists of two networks:
1. A randomly initialized, fixed target network.
2. A predictor network that learns to replicate the target's outputs for visited states.

The intrinsic reward is the mean-squared error between the predictor and the target-network features of a visited state. States that the predictor has rarely seen or has not learned yield higher errors, and thus higher intrinsic reward. Over time, states visited frequently see reduced prediction errors. RND often proves effective in high-dimensional or image-based tasks, provided states have some repeatable structure.
