### 4.6 Evaluation Methodology

This section describes how the experimental results are gathered and assessed for all tested approaches. It covers the evaluation intervals, metrics, seed variations, robustness checks, and the analysis of computational overhead versus sample efficiency. Following the guidelines in related work (Bellemare et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017; Raileanu and Rockt√§schel, 2020), this methodology aims to ensure fair, reproducible, and comprehensive comparisons across different intrinsic or extrinsic reward configurations.
