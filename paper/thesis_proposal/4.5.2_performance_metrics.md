#### 4.5.2 Performance Metrics

To determine how the agent performs under varying reward structures, multiple metrics are collected and analyzed:
- Extrinsic Episode Return
  - The total of all environment-provided rewards within each episode is measured. This metric indicates how effectively the agent addresses the stated environment objective (if any).
  - For environments with sparse or delayed rewards, reporting the final return or success rate can be more revealing than reporting intermediate progress.
- Completion or Success Rate
  - In tasks featuring goals or binary outcomes, a success/failure indicator is collected per episode. 
  - This metric helps clarify how often the agent achieves the task condition, which may be more insightful than raw return in highly sparse scenarios.
- Intrinsic Reward Signals
  - In tasks incorporating curiosity-driven exploration, the internal bonus is recorded to identify whether the agent continues to seek unexplored states, or whether it saturates quickly.
  - This is not used for policy updates during evaluation episodes, but is logged to study exploration behavior during training.
- State or Coverage Measures
  - For environments in which coverage is relevant, approximations of visited regions can be tracked. 
  - The purpose is to ascertain how broadly the agent explores beyond immediate extrinsic incentives.
- Action or Policy Entropy
  - A measure of action distribution entropy may be collected to examine the diversity of exploration. A steep decline in entropy can indicate early convergence or insufficient exploration.

These metrics are subsequently visualized through curves or summarized in tables to facilitate comparative analysis across different algorithms or hyperparameter configurations.
