#### 2.5.5 Outlook for Partially Random Environments

These self-supervised and variational methods provide robust frameworks for open-ended exploration and skill discovery in partially random domains. Key directions include:
- Avoiding Unlearnable Noise
  - Bayesian or ensemble-based approaches typically discount purely random transitions once recognized, preventing wasted time on noise.
- Discovering Controllable Skills
  - Mutual-information criteria push the agent to find states or trajectory segments it can reliably produce, even amid stochastic elements.
- Leveraging Learned Models
  - Self-supervised world models not only enable targeted exploration but also deliver rapid adaptation when external tasks later appear.

Despite these gains, challenges remain: large-scale tasks demand careful balancing of computational overhead in ensemble or variational methods; multi-step planning with partial observability complicates closed-loop skill discovery. Nevertheless, the synergy of self-supervised dynamics, variational skill discovery, and adaptive curiosity represents a promising avenue for learning intricate, re-usable behaviors in open-ended, partially random RL scenarios.
