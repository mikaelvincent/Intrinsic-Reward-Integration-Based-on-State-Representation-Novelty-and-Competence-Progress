### 3.3 Simulation Frameworks

Tasks studied in partially random RL often rely on simulation environments capable of generating diverse layouts or dynamics:
- MuJoCo (Todorov et al., 2012) is widely used for continuous control due to its efficient physics, supporting multi-joint bodies with contact. It enables large-scale training of robotic locomotion or manipulation policies under partial randomness (Peters & Schaal, 2008; Groth et al., 2021).
- Minigrid and Miniworld (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2023) are modular 2D and 3D environments with random seeds for layout generation, commonly used to evaluate exploration in sparse or procedurally generated tasks (Raileanu & Rockt√§schel, 2020).

Procedural generation ensures the agent cannot rely on memorized trajectories or repeated states (Ostrovski et al., 2017). Instead, robust curiosity or ensemble-based exploration must generalize across many environment variants (Pathak et al., 2019).
