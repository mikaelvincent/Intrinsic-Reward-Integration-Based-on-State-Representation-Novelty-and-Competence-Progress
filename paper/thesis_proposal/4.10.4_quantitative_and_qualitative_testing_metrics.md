#### 4.10.4 Quantitative and Qualitative Testing Metrics

By capturing a broad range of numerical and descriptive data throughout experiments, we plan to:
- Coverage and Exploration
  - Unique Visited States: measure coverage or novelty with a state-hashing or density-based approach (Bellemare et al., 2016).
  - Exploration Depth: e.g., number of rooms discovered in MiniGrid or levels completed in Procgen.
- Robustness to Noise
  - Noisy Subtask: artificially embed “noisy TV” states or random transitions (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
  - Evaluate if the agent’s intrinsic reward saturates or decays in random states, analyzing dwell time in those states.
- Learning Curves and Final Performance
  - Plot extrinsic returns vs. environment steps for each curiosity configuration (Huang et al., 2021).
  - Compare with relevant baselines (RND, ICM, RIDE, etc.).
- Competence Estimation
  - For CBSP, track the average skill success rate in each discovered region or subgoal across training epochs.
  - High correlation between progress metrics and policy updates indicates stable self-generated goals (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).
- Policy Visualization
  - For interpretability, visualize or log trajectories, highlighting transitions where EBIG or ANAPE is high or where CBSP indicates large learning progress (Groth et al., 2021).
