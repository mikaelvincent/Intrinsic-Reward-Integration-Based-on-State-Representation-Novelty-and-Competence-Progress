### 2.4 Handling Partially Random Subregions via Learning Progress

Knowledge-based methods that rely on learning progress explicitly concentrate on transitions where the agent can reduce its prediction error or improve its model. For example, robust intelligent adaptive curiosity (R-IAC) introduced by (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009) partitions the state-action space and tracks local learning progress. The method progressively dedicates exploration to regions where predictions keep improving, avoiding unlearnable or trivially simple areas. This notion of learning progress can be especially valuable when certain portions of the environment are inherently random, since repeated failures to reduce prediction error alert the algorithm to shift exploration elsewhere.
