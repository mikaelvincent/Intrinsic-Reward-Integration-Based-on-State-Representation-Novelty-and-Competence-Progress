#### 4.3.4 Ant

A four-legged robot in a physics simulator, aiming to maintain stable locomotion in a high-dimensional continuous domain:
- States: A vector of robot joint angles, velocities, and optional contact forces, typically yielding around 100 features.
- Actions: Eight continuous torques (one per joint).
- Reward: Combines forward-progress terms, control costs, and healthy posture bonuses; ends if the robot falls or a step budget is reached.
- Partial Randomization: Random masses or friction coefficients can be assigned each episode to test robust control strategies.
