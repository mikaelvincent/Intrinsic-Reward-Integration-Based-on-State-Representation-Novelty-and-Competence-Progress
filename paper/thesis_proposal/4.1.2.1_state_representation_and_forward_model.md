##### 4.1.2.1 State Representation and Forward Model

A learned embedding network $\phi$ maps high-dimensional or raw observations $s_t$ into a compact feature vector $\phi(s_t)$. This embedding is jointly updated with a forward-modeling objective:
- Forward Dynamics: Predict $\phi(s_{t+1})$ from $\phi(s_t)$ and action $a_t$.
- Inverse Dynamics: Predict the action $a_t$ from $\phi(s_t)$ and $\phi(s_{t+1})$.

The forward model's mean-squared error tracks how accurately controllable transitions are captured in feature space. A set of local partition structures (subregions) may be maintained for tracking error and improvement (learning progress) in different portions of the state-action domain. Each subregion updates local model parameters or error statistics whenever it is visited, allowing the approach to differentiate learnable transitions from unlearnable noise.
