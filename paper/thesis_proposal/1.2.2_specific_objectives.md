#### 1.2.2 Specific Objectives

To achieve our general objective, we outline the following specific objectives:
1. Design an intrinsic reward framework
   - Develop an intrinsic reward scheme that integrates:
     - Knowledge-based exploration signals, specifically Bayesian ensemble disagreement and uncertainty reduction (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Pathak et al., 2019).
     - Aleatoric uncertainty-adjusted prediction errors to discount irreducible environment noise (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
     - Competence-based exploration signals to track skill improvement and goal-directed progress (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Eysenbach et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2016).
2. Implement an adaptive weighting mechanism
   - Formulate and integrate an adaptive weighting approach that dynamically adjusts the relative importance of the intrinsic signals based on factors such as policy entropy and local state visitation frequency (Huang et al., 2021; Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).
3. Evaluate in partially random environments
   - Conduct experiments using a diverse suite of procedurally generated and partially random reinforcement learning tasks (Bellemare et al., 2016; Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).
   - Measure the agent's exploration efficiency, task coverage, and robustness to irreducible noise compared to baseline methods.
4. Conduct ablation studies and analysis
   - Systematically remove or isolate each intrinsic reward component and compare static versus adaptive weighting.
   - Analyze exploration patterns, intrinsic reward saturation, and competence development across multiple environment seeds.
5. Perform empirical validation against baselines
   - Compare our proposed method against established intrinsic exploration approaches such as ICM, RND, RIDE, VIME, and DIAYN (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018; Eysenbach et al., 2018; Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017; Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).
   - Assess relative performance in terms of task completion, exploration depth, efficiency, and robustness under varying degrees of environment randomness.
