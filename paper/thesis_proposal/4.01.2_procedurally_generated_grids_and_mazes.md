#### 4.01.2 Procedurally Generated Grids and Mazes

MiniGrid (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020) provides a family of grid-based worlds, each featuring partial observability and object interactions. We adopt the following scenarios:
- DoorKey Random
  - A small grid with a locked door and a key placed in random locations each episode.
  - Partial randomness is introduced by randomizing the starting position of the agent, location of the key, and shape of the walls.
  - The agent must learn how to pick up the key and unlock the door to reach a reward. This poses a moderate exploration challenge (Bellemare et al., 2016).
- MultiRoom-N
  - Consists of multiple connected rooms, each containing random placements of objects and sub-doors.
  - The layout is regenerated for every episode, ensuring the agent rarely sees the same configuration. This setup intensifies the problem of partial randomness, as even the corridor connections can differ significantly.
  - Building on prior curiosity results (Burda, Edwards, Storkey, & Klimov, 2018; Pathak et al., 2017), we expect advanced exploration methods to exhibit more consistent coverage.
- Noisy-TV Add-On
  - Following prior methods for injecting “unlearnable” randomness (Jarrett et al., 2022; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021), we introduce a “noisy TV” tile inside one of the rooms.
  - The tile cycles through random pixel patterns upon agent interaction, providing a strong partial-randomness distractor.

For each environment, the extrinsic reward is typically granted only upon achieving the final objective (e.g., unlocking the door, exiting the last room). This yields sparse external signals, encouraging reliance on intrinsic motivations (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007; Bellemare et al., 2016).
