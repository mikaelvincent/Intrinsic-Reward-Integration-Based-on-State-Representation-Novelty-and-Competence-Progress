#### 4.09.3 Budget and Cost Management

Below is a practical budget for the entire duration of the project. The main expenses include computational resources, minor software licenses, and potential data collection or environment fees.

| Item                 | Estimated Cost (PHP) | Rationale                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| GPU Cloud Credits    | 12,000               | Cloud instance hours for large-scale RL training (2â€“3 months). |
| Misc. Software Tools | 3,000                | Upgrades or fees (e.g., subscriptions, code tools). |
| Reference Materials  | 2,000                | Acquiring specialized e-books or paywalled papers.             |
| Contingency          | 3,000                | Cover unexpected or incidental project costs.                  |
| TOTAL                | 20,000               | Overall sum ensuring coverage of main project needs.           |

All items aim to keep the project cost manageable while ensuring stable, reproducible RL experiments. Unexpected overruns may occur if additional extended runs or environment licensing become necessary, but the current allocation is expected to suffice. Cost usage is tracked monthly to avoid overspending.
