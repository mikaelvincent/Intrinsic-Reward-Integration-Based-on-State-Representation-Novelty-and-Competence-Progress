### 1.3 Significance of the Study

Many existing curiosity frameworks excel in domains where states repeat or noise is minimal, but fall short in “hard-exploration” tasks with partial randomness or procedural variation (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021; Jarrett et al., 2022). Agents either waste time on unlearnable transitions or fixate solely on novel states without building deeper skills or mastering subgoals (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).

This study’s multi-pronged approach to adaptive curiosity is significant for several reasons such as:
- Robust Exploration Under Noise
  - By discounting irreducible noise (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021), we expect to overcome the “noisy TV” effect that cripples naive novelty-based methods (Pathak et al., 2017; Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018).
- Open-Ended Skill Acquisition
  - Adding a competence-based module fosters emergent multi-step or goal-directed behavior, benefiting real-world settings where extrinsic rewards may be sparse or not easily engineered (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007; Eysenbach et al., 2018).
- Procedural and Large Domains
  - Techniques that unify knowledge-based, noise-aware, and competence-based signals are better poised to handle large or procedurally generated tasks (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020; Bellemare et al., 2016). Overcoming the limitations of single-signal methods yields broader applicability in real-life or simulation-based RL.
- Theoretical and Practical Contributions
  - Showing how Bayesian or ensemble-based curiosity (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019), noise subtraction (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021), and competence progress (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009) can coherently mesh under adaptive weighting clarifies the design space of intrinsic motivations. Positive empirical results would push forward the frontier of robust exploration, bridging advanced RL methodology and real-world tasks.

Thus, beyond pure academic interest, successful outcomes of this research could influence the design of next-generation agents for robotics, open-ended simulation tasks, or human-robot collaboration, where partial randomness and sparse feedback are pervasive.
