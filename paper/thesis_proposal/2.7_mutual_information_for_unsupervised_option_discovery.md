### 2.7 Mutual Information for Unsupervised Option Discovery

Researchers have also explored intrinsic motivation as a tool for discovering reusable skills or "options" in partially random or complex environments. In Variational Intrinsic Control (VIC), (Gregor et al., 2016) maximized the mutual information between a skill variable and the final state, encouraging the discovery of policies that lead to distinguishable outcomes. Similarly, Diversity is All You Need (DIAYN) (Eysenbach et al., 2018) used mutual information between latent skill labels and states to learn diverse behaviors. Both methods aim to avoid random transitions that do not convey consistent skill information, aligning with the impetus to discount uncontrolled randomness.
