##### 3.3.2.3 Hybrid and Impact-Driven Signals
Other solutions unify multiple curiosity channels. For instance, **RIDE** encourages *agent-controllable changes* in a learned embedding (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020). If repeated toggling yields no new representation shift, the agent quickly loses interest, thus partial randomness becomes less attractive. Meanwhile, **Curiosity in Hindsight** (Jarrett et al., 2022) infers “hindsight” latent variables capturing the environment’s uncontrollable aspects, effectively filtering out transitions that are unpredictable for purely random reasons. In each step, a latent variable \(z_{t+1}\sim q(\cdot \mid s_{t+1},s_t,a_t)\) captures *noise factors*, so the agent’s intrinsic bonus only reflects *learnable differences* in the environment (Jarrett et al., 2022).
