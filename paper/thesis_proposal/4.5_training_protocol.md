### 4.5 Training Protocol

This section describes how the experiments are conducted in practice. It covers the budgets used for episodes and time steps, data collection procedures and storage, hyperparameter configurations, and the computational setup for parallelization. The guidelines herein align with established practices in previous work on sparse or partially random reinforcement learning tasks (Bellemare et al., 2016; Raileanu and Rockt√§schel, 2020; Houthooft et al., 2016).
