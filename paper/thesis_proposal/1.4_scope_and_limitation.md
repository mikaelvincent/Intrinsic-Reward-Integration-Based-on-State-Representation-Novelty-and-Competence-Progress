### 1.4 Scope and Limitation

Given these motivations, the scope of the study is:
- We concentrate on partially random or procedurally generated environments, primarily in grid-based (MiniGrid) or custom continuous-control tasks with random seeds for layout, initial states, or extrinsic elements (Bellemare et al., 2016; Raileanu & Rockt√§schel, 2020).
- Our intrinsic reward focuses on three signals: ensemble-based epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty discounting, and competence-based progress, each combined via an adaptive weighting scheme (Huang et al., 2021).

Despite these expansions, our approach has certain limitations:
- Computational Overhead
  - Maintaining ensembles and competence modules can be more expensive than single-signal or naive exploration. We mitigate this by restricting ensemble sizes and applying parallelization, but large-scale tasks may still be resource-intensive (Pathak et al., 2019).
- High-Dimensional Visual Inputs
  - While we apply standard CNN encoders or partial random embeddings (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018), extremely high-resolution domains may require more advanced or domain-specific representation learning.
- Long-Horizon Dependencies
  - Our proposed method primarily addresses immediate or short-term curiosity signals (e.g., immediate information gain or skill progress). Truly long-horizon tasks with extended partial observability might require hierarchical or memory-based expansions (Eysenbach et al., 2018).
- Limited Real-World Validation
  - Our experiments focus on simulation. Although we reference real-world applications and partial randomness, bridging to physical robotics would demand further safety constraints and real-time efficiency considerations (Frank et al., 2014; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).

Despite these constraints, the approach aims to demonstrate proof-of-concept and highlight fundamental principles for adaptive curiosity in partially random RL contexts.
