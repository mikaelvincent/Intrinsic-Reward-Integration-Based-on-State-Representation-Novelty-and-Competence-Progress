### 1.4 Scope and Limitation

We focus on adaptive curiosity-driven exploration strategies for reinforcement learning (RL) agents operating within partially random and procedurally generated environments. Specifically, we examine tasks characterized by stochastic transitions, variable layouts, or randomized object placements. We primarily employ grid-based environments and continuous control tasks featuring random initializations, seeds, or extrinsic elements (Bellemare et al., 2016; Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).

Our adaptive curiosity framework integrates three distinct intrinsic reward signals: ensemble-based epistemic uncertainty estimation, aleatoric uncertainty subtraction, and competence-based skill progress. These components are combined through an adaptive weighting scheme designed to dynamically emphasize the most contextually relevant signals throughout training (Huang et al., 2021).

Despite the advantages of our proposed approach, we acknowledge several limitations:
- Integrating multiple curiosity modules—especially ensembles and competence-based tracking—can result in increased computational demands compared to simpler or single-signal methods. Although we mitigate this overhead through parallelization and controlled ensemble sizes, scalability to significantly larger environments or extensive training scenarios may remain computationally challenging (Pathak et al., 2019).
- Our approach relies on standard convolutional neural network encoders or embeddings suitable for typical RL environments. However, tasks featuring extremely high-dimensional visual inputs or significantly richer sensory modalities may require more specialized representation-learning methods (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018).
- Our intrinsic reward components are primarily designed to address immediate or short-term exploration challenges, such as immediate reductions in uncertainty or short-term skill improvement. While effective for most tasks under study, scenarios involving highly extended temporal horizons or prolonged partial observability may necessitate additional hierarchical or memory-based extensions (Eysenbach et al., 2018).
- Our experiments are confined to simulated environments. Although we reference potential real-world applications characterized by partial randomness, direct validation with physical robotic systems or real-world deployments remains beyond the scope of this study. Transitioning to physical platforms would require addressing additional safety constraints, real-time operation, and practical efficiency considerations (Frank et al., 2014; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).

Overall, we aim to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and theoretical grounding of our adaptive curiosity mechanism in simulated scenarios that closely reflect realistic challenges, despite these acknowledged constraints.
