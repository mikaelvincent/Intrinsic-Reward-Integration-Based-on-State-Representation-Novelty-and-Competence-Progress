#### 4.09.1 Schedule and Timeline

We aim to complete major experimental work by August 2025 to ensure we have sufficient time for final analyses. If earlier tasks conclude ahead of schedule, the buffer can be used for deeper ablations or optional expansions.

| Month/Period       | Planned Activity                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **February 2025**  | - Finalize design & environment setup.<br>- Implement initial single-signal agent (ensemble-based or competence-based alone).<br>- Preliminary tests on small tasks.              |
| **March 2025**     | - Integrate second and third intrinsic signals (EBIG + ANAPE + CBSP).<br>- Develop adaptive weighting scheme.<br>- Conduct partial random environment trials (MiniGrid variants). |
| **April 2025**     | - Mid-development reviews & ablations.<br>- Adjust hyperparameters.<br>- Prepare expansions to more complex tasks or procedural tasks.                                            |
| **May 2025**       | - Run large-scale experiments on advanced or more random tasks (Procgen-based).<br>- Gather coverage & performance data.<br>- Debug or refine weighting transitions.              |
| **June 2025**      | - Compare final approach vs. known baselines across multiple seeds.<br>- Document results thoroughly.                                                      |
| **July 2025**      | - Additional ablations, final polishing.<br>- Summarize findings for drafts of result sections.                                                                                   |
| **August 2025**    | - Final checks, code clean-up, and final documentation.<br>- Conclude experiments, finalize thesis text.<br>- Preparation for thesis defense.                                     |
