### 4.08 Software Development Tools

Our implementation leverages widely adopted libraries and tools to streamline development and experimentation:
- Programming Language and Core Libraries
  - Python 3.x as the primary language, given its extensive RL ecosystem.
  - PyTorch for neural network models, facilitating GPU-accelerated training of ensemble-based dynamics and policy networks.
  - NumPy and SciPy for numerical operations, matrix routines, and random processes.
- RL Frameworks
  - Stable Baselines3 or RLlib for standard RL algorithms. Incorporating curiosity modules into these frameworks is supported in prior works.
  - Integration with custom components through well-defined interfaces.
- Task Environments
  - Gymnasium or MiniGrid environment wrappers for easy procedural generation.
  - Procgen environment suite to test large-scale partial randomness.
  - Optional direct use of Atari wrappers for further coverage.
- Experiment Management
  - Weights & Biases or TensorBoard for logging: track training curves, coverage metrics, and intrinsic rewards.
  - Git for version control, ensuring consistent branching, code reviews, and experiment reproducibility.
- Data Storage and Plotting
  - Pandas for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for coverage heatmaps, reward distributions, and skill-progress plots.

In synergy, these tools offer robust support for the iterative, experiment-centric development approach. By reusing established RL frameworks and standard code patterns, we concentrate on novel aspects: unifying ensemble-based info gain, aleatoric noise subtraction, and competence progress in a single agent.
