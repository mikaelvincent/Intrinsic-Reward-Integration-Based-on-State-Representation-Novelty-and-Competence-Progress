#### 3.4.1 Forward-Model Error and Ensemble Disagreement

Forward-model-based curiosity computes $\|f_\phi(s_t,a_t) - s_{t+1}\|$ as an intrinsic signal (Pathak et al., 2017). However, purely random transitions can maintain large errors. Ensemble methods (Pathak et al., 2019) reduce this failure by awarding the variance across multiple forward models instead of raw error. Once random states are recognized as unlearnable, the ensemble converges, yielding near-zero disagreement (Jarrett et al., 2022).
