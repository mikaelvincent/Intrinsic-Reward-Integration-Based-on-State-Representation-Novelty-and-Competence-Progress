#### 4.01.4 High-Dimensional Control MuJoCo Variation

To test scalability in continuous high-dimensional tasks (Houthooft et al., 2016; Peters & Schaal, 2008; Eysenbach et al., 2018), we use MuJoCo physics-based environments with embedded partial randomness:
- Swimmer-R
  - A variant of the standard Swimmer environment where random “currents” push the agent unpredictably at each step (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
  - The agent must still move forward to gain extrinsic reward, but repeated unpredictable pushes can hamper naive exploration.
- HalfCheetah-R
  - Similarly, the HalfCheetah agent experiences random friction changes or wind forces.
  - Agents must identify robust locomotive patterns that adapt to these partial random phenomena (Groth et al., 2021).
