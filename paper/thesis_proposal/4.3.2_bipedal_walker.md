#### 4.3.2 Bipedal Walker

A 2D continuous-control benchmark testing walking stability, joint coordination, and handling of uneven terrain:
- States: Numerical observations of joint angles, angular velocities, hull tilt, ground contacts, and optional LIDAR range-finder readings.
- Actions: Four continuous torques $\in [-1,1]$, each controlling a hip or knee joint.
- Reward: Primarily a sparse or delayed measure for moving forward without falling, plus small shaping terms. Episodes end if the robot topples or steps exceed a maximum limit.
- Partial Randomization: Mass or friction can be varied each episode to ensure robust strategies.
