#### 4.05.5 Summary of Expected Contributions

Drawing from our theoretical and empirical approach, we highlight these key contributions and expected outcomes:
- Novel Hybrid
  - Merges two knowledge-based signals (EBIG + ANAPE) with a competence-based signal (CBSP) under a single adaptive weighting framework.
- Robustness to Partial Randomness
  - The synergy of ensemble-based info gain and aleatoric noise subtraction systematically avoids “noisy TV” pitfalls, while competence-based progress encourages stable skill acquisition.
- Comprehensive Evaluation
  - Extensive ablations to confirm each signal’s added value.
  - Comparison with prior single-signal curiosity methods (Bellemare et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021).

We thus expect that adaptive curiosity in partially random RL settings can be significantly advanced by this multi-signal design, potentially opening new avenues for robust exploration and skill learning.
