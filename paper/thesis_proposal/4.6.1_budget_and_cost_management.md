#### 4.6.1 Budget and Cost Management

Cloud-based experimentation on Microsoft Azure is assumed for this study, prioritizing GPU usage only when necessary to contain costs. This section details anticipated compute time, associated expenses, and strategies to optimize the budget while allowing thorough execution of all experimental runs.

##### 4.6.1.1 Cost Estimates by Environment

- Mountain Car
  - Compute: Utilizes a small 4-core CPU virtual machine (VM) with no GPU requirement. Each training run is expected to complete in approximately two hours. Multiple runs cumulatively demand around 10 compute hours at roughly ₱10 per hour, leading to an estimated ₱100 total cost.
  - Storage: Minimal, with only a few megabytes required for logs.
- Bipedal Walker
  - Compute: Runs efficiently on a CPU-only VM. Each run takes around four hours, totaling about 36 CPU hours across multiple seeds. At approximately ₱10 per hour, the projected cost is ₱400.
  - Storage: Negligible (<1 GB for checkpoint data and logs).
- Car Racing
  - Compute: Requires a GPU-enabled instance due to image-based observations. A mid-range NVIDIA T4 GPU VM (~₱30 per hour) typically trains for up to 24 hours per run. Multiple runs over about 216 GPU hours sum to ₱12,000 in compute costs.
  - Storage: Each run uses approximately 5–10 GB (model checkpoints and occasional rendered frames), incurring only minor storage fees.
- Ant
  - Compute: Uses a higher-end CPU instance to manage physics-based simulation. Each run averages 12 hours; with an estimated 108 CPU hours total at roughly ₱10 per hour, costs reach ₱1,100.
  - Storage: Small (<5 GB) for saving logs and intermediate artifacts.
- Half Cheetah
  - Compute: Similar to Ant, CPU-only VMs support the physics simulation. Each run requires around eight hours, with \~72 CPU hours total at ₱10 per hour, leading to ₱800 in compute costs.
  - Storage: Small, typically under a few gigabytes.
- Humanoid
  - Compute: Represents the most computationally demanding environment. Each run can span one to two days on a 16-core CPU VM, totaling around 432 CPU hours over multiple seeds. At ₱10 per hour, the expense is about ₱5,000.
  - Storage: Approximately 5–10 GB per run for checkpoints and logs.

Overall, the total budget allocation for compute across all environments is approximately ₱20,000, with Car Racing and Humanoid incurring the largest shares due to elevated simulation and training demands.

##### 4.6.1.2 Compute Resource Selection and Time Requirements

Lower-dimensional tasks (e.g., Mountain Car, Bipedal Walker) rely on basic CPU-only VMs, completing runs within a few hours each. Car Racing requires a GPU-based setup due to its convolutional networks for image processing, shortening training to around 24 hours per run. The continuous-control environments (Ant, Half Cheetah, Humanoid) leverage multi-core CPU resources to parallelize physics simulations and achieve feasible runtimes. Even so, Humanoid remains the most time-intensive given its complexity, typically requiring one to two days per run.

##### 4.6.1.3 Cost Optimization Strategies

- Spot (Preemptible) Instances
  - Whenever appropriate, spot VMs are employed to reduce hourly rates. Regular checkpointing ensures minimal data loss if a VM is reclaimed.
- Right-Sizing Resources
  - Each environment uses a VM with specifications matched to its computational demands. GPU resources are reserved primarily for environments that benefit from accelerated training (e.g., Car Racing).
- Sequential Scheduling
  - Experiments are run in sequence on the same instances to avoid idle periods. Automated scripts shut down VMs as soon as training completes, preventing unnecessary costs.
