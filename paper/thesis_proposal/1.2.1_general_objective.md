#### 1.2.1 General Objective

We aim to develop and empirically validate a multi-component adaptive curiosity mechanism for reinforcement learning agents in partially random and procedurally generated environments. Our approach seeks to enable agents to systematically explore and improve their internal models and skills while effectively identifying and discounting irreducibly noisy elements. Through this adaptive curiosity framework, we aim to ensure robust exploration and prevent stagnation in purely stochastic regions (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2019).
