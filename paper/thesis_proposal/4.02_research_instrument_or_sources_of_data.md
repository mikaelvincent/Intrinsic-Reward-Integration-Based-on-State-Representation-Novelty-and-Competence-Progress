### 4.02 Research Instrument or Sources of Data

This section outlines the instruments and data sources employed for the experimental component of our study, "Adaptive Curiosity for Exploration in Partially Random Reinforcement Learning (RL) Environments." We first describe the environments used as data-generating instruments, detailing how partial randomness is introduced procedurally. Next, we explain the intrinsic reward instruments—including Bayesian ensemble models, competence-based tracking modules, and uncertainty-estimation components—that produce our agent’s self-supervised or curiosity-driven data. We conclude with a summary of logs and metrics recorded for subsequent analysis.
