#### 3.4.3 Impact-Driven and Competence-Progress Methods

Impact-driven approaches measure how much the agent's action changes a learned state representation (Raileanu & Rockt√§schel, 2020). Because purely stochastic transitions often do not reflect agent-induced changes, the bonus naturally decays in random subregions. Competence-based or "learning progress" signals (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Groth et al., 2021) focus on transitions that yield consistent improvements in model accuracy or skill mastery. Both classes circumvent infinite curiosity loops by devaluing outcomes not furthering the agent's internal competence.
