#### 4.10.3 Testing with Realistic Procedural Benchmarks

Following verification in smaller tasks, we apply the full approach to procedurally generated or partially random RL domains:
- MiniGrid & KeyCorridor (Raileanu & Rockt√§schel, 2020)
  - Hard exploration, extended partial randomness, locked doors, and distractors.
  - Intrinsic signals must guide discovery of keys and strategy to unlock new areas.
- Procgen Games (Cobbe et al. in prior works; see also Huang et al., 2021)
  - Large-scale, high-variance tasks like CoinRun, Heist, Climber with new random levels each episode.
  - Evaluate how quickly the agent generalizes each environment variant without fixating on irreducible noise.
- Continuous Control with Random Forces (Houthooft et al., 2016; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021)
  - High-dimensional tasks (e.g., Swimmer, HalfCheetah) but with forcibly injected random friction or wind.
  - Confirm ANAPE subcomponent effectively discounts high variance areas. 
  - EBIG remains relevant in less random transitions, while CBSP tracks skill improvements (Achiam et al., 2018).
