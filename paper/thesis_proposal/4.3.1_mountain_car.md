#### 4.3.1 Mountain Car

A simple, low-dimensional environment featuring an underpowered car in a valley aiming to drive up a steep hill:
- States: Two-dimensional $(position, velocity)$, each clipped within known bounds.
- Actions: Three discrete commands $\{\text{accel left}, \text{no-op}, \text{accel right}\}$.
- Reward: A $-1$ penalty each timestep until reaching the goal ($position \ge 0.5$); ends after 200 steps if the agent fails.
- Partial Randomization: Wind or small perturbations on velocity can be introduced, ensuring purely memorized strategies are insufficient.
