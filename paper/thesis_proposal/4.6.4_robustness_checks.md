#### 4.6.4 Robustness Checks

Given that many of the target environments exhibit partial randomization or domain shifts (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009; Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020), it is crucial to analyze each approach's stability and robustness under varied conditions:

1. Varying Noise and Randomness Levels
   - Artificially increasing environment stochasticity (e.g., random wind in Bipedal Walker, random friction in MuJoCo tasks) reveals how quickly methods discount irreducibly random regions.
   - If curiosity-driven methods (Pathak et al., 2017) or ensemble-based approaches (Pathak et al., 2019) degrade significantly with higher noise, the results confirm sensitivity to partial randomness.
2. Domain Randomization
   - Testing with different initial distributions or random seeds for environment layouts ensures that learned policies generalize (Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020).
   - For tasks like CarRacing or certain 3D simulators, partial domain randomization can be escalated from mild to heavy to see how well an algorithm maintains consistent exploration signals.
3. Ablation Studies
   - Deactivating or modifying certain components of the approach (e.g., removing the forward model, ignoring episodic visitation counters) clarifies the impact of each module (Bellemare et al., 2016).
   - If removing a region-based learning progress term drastically reduces performance, it implies that subcomponent is crucial for handling random subregions (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009).
4. Hyperparameter Sensitivity
   - Some methods rely on hyperparameters balancing extrinsic vs. intrinsic rewards (Houthooft et al., 2016). Testing a range of possible weighting factors \(\eta\) or discount rates for curiosity helps identify stable defaults.
   - Similarly, analyzing how large ensemble sizes (Pathak et al., 2019) or different hashing resolutions (Bellemare et al., 2016) affect exploration can reveal performance plateaus or diminishing returns.
5. Policy Entropy Over Time
   - Monitoring action entropy (Burda et al., 2018) may highlight whether the agent prematurely converges to a narrow, suboptimal policy. If partial random transitions cause large noise in the environment, the method must adapt exploration parameters to avoid spurious stalls.

Conducting these robustness checks ensures that methods targeting partially random or procedurally generated domains truly handle the complexities of real-world-like variability.
