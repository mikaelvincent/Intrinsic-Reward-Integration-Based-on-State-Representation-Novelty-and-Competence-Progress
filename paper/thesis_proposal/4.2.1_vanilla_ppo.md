#### 4.2.1 Vanilla PPO

Vanilla PPO is a Proximal Policy Optimization agent without any intrinsic reward signal. It optimizes a clipped objective to stabilize policy gradient updates and relies entirely on extrinsic rewards (if available) or random exploration in sparse-reward scenarios. This setup functions as a control baseline that shows how an agent performs without additional exploration incentives.
