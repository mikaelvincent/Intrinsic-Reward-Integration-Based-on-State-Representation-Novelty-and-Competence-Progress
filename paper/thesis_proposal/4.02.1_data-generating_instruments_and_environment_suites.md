#### 4.02.1 Data-Generating Instruments and Environment Suites

Our "instruments" for data collection are the standardized RL environments themselves. By deploying RL agents in these environments, we gather (state, action, next-state, reward) transitions. In partially random settings, we subject the agent to diverse seeds or procedurally generated layouts, ensuring each episodeâ€™s configuration may differ substantially. This yields a rich, high-variance dataset of experience trajectories.
