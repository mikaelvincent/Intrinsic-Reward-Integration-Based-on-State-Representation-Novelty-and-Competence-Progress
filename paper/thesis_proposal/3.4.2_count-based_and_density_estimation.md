#### 3.4.2 Count-Based and Density Estimation

Count-based exploration generalizes from tabular $\bigl(N(s)\bigr)^{-1/2}$ ideas by substituting pseudo-counts derived from a density model (Bellemare et al., 2016). These pseudo-counts mimic the notion of "novelty," with states recognized as random or uninformative leading to stable densities that no longer inflate the bonus. Advanced approaches use pixel-based or latent-based density estimators (Ostrovski et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2016) for high-dimensional observations.
