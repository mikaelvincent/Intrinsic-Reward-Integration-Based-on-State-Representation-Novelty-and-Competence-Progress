### 2.6 Summary and Gaps

Literature on curiosity-driven RL consistently demonstrates the importance of discounting irreducible noise while preserving exploration incentives for learnable novelty. Classical knowledge-based approaches (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007) and ensemble-based or Bayesian designs (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019) converge on the principle that partial randomness must be recognized and separated from agent-controllable structure (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). However, open challenges persist concerning multi-step or hierarchical tasks, large-scale real robotics, and guaranteeing stable, broad exploration without saturating on random transitions (Burda et al., 2018).
