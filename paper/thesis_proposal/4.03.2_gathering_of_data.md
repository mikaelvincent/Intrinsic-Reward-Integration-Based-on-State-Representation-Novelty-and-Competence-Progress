#### 4.03.2 Gathering of Data

Data collection refers to the agent’s rollout experiences when training under the unified adaptive curiosity framework. Specifically, we gather:
- State-Action-Next-State Transitions
  - At each time step \(t\), we record \((s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_t)\), where:
    - \(s_t\) is the current environment state or observation,
    - \(a_t\) is the action chosen by the policy,
    - \(s_{t+1}\) is the next state,
    - \(r_t\) includes both extrinsic and intrinsic components.
- Ensemble Posterior Updates
  - For Bayesian neural ensembles that approximate environment dynamics (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019), each transition is stored in a replay buffer. At intervals, we perform mini-batch updates to refine the posterior over model parameters.
- Competence Logging
  - For subgoal or skill-based exploration (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Eysenbach et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2016), each time the agent selects a subgoal or skill context, we log:
    - Which skill was sampled,
    - The agent’s observed outcome or final state,
    - A competence metric (distance from subgoal, or success ratio).
- Partial Randomness Metrics
  - We add explicit “noise markers” if a transition’s outcome is recognized as irreducibly random by the ensemble (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). Storing these markers helps measure how the agent’s curiosity handles or avoids pure noise.
- Procedural Generation Seeds
  - Each environment instance is launched with a specific random seed or generated layout. We record the seed along with high-level environment parameters (room size, obstacle layouts) for reproducibility and analysis.

Each run proceeds for a fixed horizon (e.g., 1 million time steps in smaller tasks, up to tens of millions in more complex or higher-dimensional tasks). Depending on memory constraints, transitions are stored either in a large circular buffer or partitioned by environment seed. The final dataset includes:
- Agent-environment interaction logs for all seeds,
- Model ensemble updates,
- Episode-level performance (episode returns, final coverage, or success flags).
