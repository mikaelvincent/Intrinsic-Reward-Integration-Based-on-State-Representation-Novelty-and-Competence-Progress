### 2.6 Ensemble Disagreement or Bayesian Methods for Partially Random RL

Ensemble-based or Bayesian exploration methods refine the basic notion of novelty by focusing on epistemic uncertaintyâ€”uncertainty about the environment's learnable structure. In Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME) (Houthooft et al., 2016), a Bayesian neural network captures the agent's dynamics model, and each transition updates the posterior over model parameters. The intrinsic reward is approximated by the KL divergence between prior and posterior, effectively measuring how much each new data point reduces uncertainty. Because random transitions fail to reduce the model's uncertainty in controllable aspects, their intrinsic value diminishes over time.
