#### 4.10.2 Validation Protocol in Controlled Tasks

By isolating specific environment factors in tightly constrained scenarios, we aim to:
- Small-Scale Validation in Deterministic Environments
  - Objective
    - Validate that each curiosity signal works under simpler, fully deterministic tasks before partial randomness is introduced.
  - Tasks
    - Static MiniGrid “DoorKey” or “SimpleRoom” with no randomization (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).
    - Basic continuous-control tasks like MountainCar with minimal or no noise (Bellemare et al., 2016).
  - Assessment
    - Compare final policy performance and intrinsic reward patterns with known or expectable exploration patterns (Ladosz et al., 2022).
    - Check that the agent’s curiosity quickly vanishes in fully explored subspaces.
- Partial Randomness Introduction
  - Objective
    - Gradually increase environment stochasticity to observe how EBIG and ANAPE discount unlearnable transitions and how CBSP avoids or leaves stagnating subregions.
  - Method
    - For MiniGrid or Procgen tasks (Huang et al., 2021), vary the fraction of random objects or random transitions. Analyze the agent’s coverage, final returns, and the ratio of repeated visits to random states.
- Ablation Comparisons
  - Objective
    - Demonstrate the necessity of each module.
  - Method
    - Evaluate “EBIG-only,” “ANAPE-only,” “CBSP-only,” and “EBIG+ANAPE,” “EBIG+CBSP,” “ANAPE+CBSP,” comparing them to the full tri-component version.
    - Metrics: sample efficiency, final returns, random-state dwell time (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
