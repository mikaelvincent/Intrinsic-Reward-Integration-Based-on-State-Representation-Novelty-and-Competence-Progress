#### 4.2.3 Reset and Termination Rules

Each environment is run under standard rules, with no major changes unless otherwise stated:
- Mountain Car
  - Episodes end upon reaching the goal state (car position â‰¥ 0.5) or after 200 steps. The agent is reset to a random position near the valley bottom, with zero velocity.
- Bipedal Walker
  - Episodes end if the agent falls (hull angle too large) or after a fixed time limit (e.g., 1600 steps). The agent is reset to a standing posture with near-zero velocity. Domain-randomization seeds might alter terrain slopes or stumps.
- Car Racing
  - Episodes terminate if the car exits track boundaries for too long or completes a lap. A maximum step limit (e.g., 2000 steps) also triggers termination. Each reset samples a new track layout, randomizing color or tile distribution.
- Ant, Half Cheetah, Humanoid
  - In MuJoCo tasks, episodes terminate if the robot violates joint constraints (e.g., falls) or exceeds a time limit (commonly 1000 steps). Upon reset, joint positions and velocities are sampled from small random distributions around a nominal posture (Todorov et al., 2012).

In each domain, the environment's partial randomness is reinitialized upon reset. This ensures that consecutive episodes differ in initial states or physical parameters, preserving the intended challenge of discovering robust, generalizable policies.
