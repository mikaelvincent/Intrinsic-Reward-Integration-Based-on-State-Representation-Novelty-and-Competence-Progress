#### 4.02.3 Data Collection and Logging Protocols

Throughout training, we collect:
1. Raw Transition Data
   - \((s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_{\mathrm{ext}}, r^i_t)\) for each time step.
   - Episode-level metadata (e.g., environment seeds, partial random parameters) for cross-episode analysis.
2. Model-Related Logs
   - Ensemble predictions (\(\hat{\mu}_{t+1}, \hat{\Sigma}_{t+1}\)), disagreement values, Bayesian parameter updates (KL divergences).
   - Competence-based logs: subgoal chosen, success measure, \(\Delta\) in skill accuracy, region assignments (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).
3. Performance and Exploration Metrics
   - Extrinsic returns per episode.
   - Coverage metrics: fraction of unique states visited or discovered subregions in a latent representation (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018).
   - Noisy region visits: how often the agent enters known unlearnable transitions (like random flickers or action-based noise).
   - Adaptive weighting logs: \(\alpha_t,\beta_t,\gamma_t\) histories.
4. Reference Baselines
   - We run parallel experiments with ICM (Pathak et al., 2017), RND (Burda, Edwards, Storkey, & Klimov, 2018), VIME (Houthooft et al., 2016), and RIDE (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020) for comparison.
   - The same instrumentation process logs each baseline’s intrinsic reward signals for direct analysis.
