#### 4.5.4 Seed Variations and Aggregation

To ensure that results do not hinge on a particular stochastic initialization, multiple independent runs are conducted under distinct random seeds. Each run starts with a different seed for both neural network parameters and environment states. The purpose of this approach is to highlight the average behavior and to assess the consistency of each method.

For each algorithm-environment pair:
- A fixed number of seeds (e.g., three or five) is used.
- Performance curves are recorded for each seed.
- The mean and standard deviation across seeds are computed for the final performance measure at designated training steps.

This multi-seed protocol is applied to evaluate both the stability (via variance) and overall effectiveness (via mean performance) of the tested approach.
