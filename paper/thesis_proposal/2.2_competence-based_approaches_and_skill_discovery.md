### 2.2 Competence-Based Approaches and Skill Discovery

Competence-based exploration methods focus on an agent’s self-assessment of “how well” it is mastering certain goals or tasks, rather than relying only on state novelty or surprise. Instead of viewing learning solely as a process of reducing prediction error (i.e., knowledge-based intrinsic rewards), competence-based frameworks encourage an agent to set self-generated goals and measure its progress in achieving them (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007). The agent’s internal reward often derives from **competence progress**—the rate at which it improves its ability to attain newly chosen targets (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009). This section examines how competence-driven objectives relate to skill discovery and the broader context of open-ended exploration.
