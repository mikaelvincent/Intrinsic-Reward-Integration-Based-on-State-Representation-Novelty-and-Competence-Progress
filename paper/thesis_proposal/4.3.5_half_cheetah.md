#### 4.3.5 Half Cheetah

A planar robot with six degrees of freedom and a single leg pair, tested primarily on forward locomotion:
- States: Joint positions, joint velocities, and inertial data, typically yielding around 17 features.
- Actions: Six continuous torques corresponding to thigh and shin joints.
- Reward: Forward velocity minus minor control costs, with no direct penalty for flips or abnormal poses unless custom shaping is introduced.
- Partial Randomization: Episode-level variations in mass or friction, ensuring that naive memorization does not suffice.
