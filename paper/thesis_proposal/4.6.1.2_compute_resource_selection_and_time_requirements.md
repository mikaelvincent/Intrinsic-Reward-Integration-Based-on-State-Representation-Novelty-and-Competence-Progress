##### 4.6.1.2 Compute Resource Selection and Time Requirements

Lower-dimensional tasks (e.g., Mountain Car, Bipedal Walker) rely on basic CPU-only VMs, completing runs within a few hours each. Car Racing requires a GPU-based setup due to its convolutional networks for image processing, shortening training to around 24 hours per run. The continuous-control environments (Ant, Half Cheetah, Humanoid) leverage multi-core CPU resources to parallelize physics simulations and achieve feasible runtimes. Even so, Humanoid remains the most time-intensive given its complexity, typically requiring one to two days per run.
