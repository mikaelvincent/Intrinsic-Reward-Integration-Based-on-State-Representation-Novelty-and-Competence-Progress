#### 2.3.3 Practical Benefits and Ongoing Challenges

Multi-signal methods often report **higher final performance** and **faster exploration** in sparse domains, including difficult Atari games like *Montezuma’s Revenge* or extensive grid-based tasks (Huang et al., 2021; Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020). Some key advantages include:

- **Robustness to Noise:** When purely random transitions do not reduce one’s predictive error, an alternate novelty or competence measure can discount these transitions.  
- **Stable Long-Horizon Exploration:** Agents can rotate among signals—e.g., using curiosity for coverage, then skill-based goals for deeper mastery—thus mitigating each signal’s decay or oversaturation.  
- **Adaptability Across Different Stages**: As environments shift from “unknown and broad” to “locally known with challenging subregions,” an adaptive weighting ensures the agent remains motivated to discover new tasks or refine existing skills.

However, **integrating multiple signals** raises complexity in hyperparameter tuning (Huang et al., 2021). Overly aggressive weighting on a single term might overshadow others, leading to either an “exploration drift” or a partial reversion to single-signal pitfalls. Further, the agent’s need to maintain multiple learning modules (e.g., separate networks for novelty detection, forward dynamics, or ensemble disagreement) increases computational overhead. Balancing these concerns against the **substantial gains** in exploration effectiveness is an active area of ongoing research.

In summary, **hybrid and multi-signal intrinsic reward methods** deliver a promising route to more **resilient exploration**, particularly in domains that are large, have high-dimensional inputs, or contain **substantial partial randomness**. By unifying distinct curiosity signals—be they knowledge-based, competence-based, or ensemble-based—researchers continue to push exploration algorithms toward robust, stable, and comprehensive coverage of complex reinforcement learning environments.
