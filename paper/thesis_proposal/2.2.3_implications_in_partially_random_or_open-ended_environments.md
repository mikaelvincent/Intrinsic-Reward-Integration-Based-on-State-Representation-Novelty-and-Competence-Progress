#### 2.2.3 Implications in Partially Random or Open-Ended Environments

In partially random domains, competence-based exploration enjoys significant advantages. If environment noise or certain transitions are unlearnable, a purely novelty-driven strategy might repeatedly chase stochastic events (the so-called “noisy TV” problem). By contrast, an agent that measures how well it “masters” transitions or goals naturally discounts irreducible randomness. Once a region yields no further competence gains (e.g., it is either trivial or hopelessly random), exploration shifts elsewhere (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009). Additionally, skill discovery methods such as DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2018) or VALOR (Achiam et al., 2018) benefit from focusing on stable, controllable modes instead of ephemeral noise, since each learned skill must remain reliably identifiable.

Overall, competence-based and skill-discovery approaches can drive systematic exploration in partially random or procedurally generated settings, enabling agents to accumulate a library of robust behaviors. They complement knowledge-based methods by centering on **achievable mastery**, which in turn fosters incremental self-improvement, structured exploration, and flexible re-use of emergent skills across diverse tasks.
