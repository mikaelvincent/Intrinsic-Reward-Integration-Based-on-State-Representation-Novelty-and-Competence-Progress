#### 4.4.3 Key Differences vs. Existing Methods

1. Focus on Partial Randomness
   - Unlike purely novelty-based strategies (cf. Bellemare et al., 2016; Burda et al., 2018), this approach explicitly discounts or filters subregions where the forward-model error does not diminish, preventing infinite exploration of irreducibly random transitions (Pathak et al., 2019).
2. Region-Level Learning Progress
   - Instead of globally weighting forward-model prediction error, each local partition tracks "improvement" across repeated interactions. This region-based framework is more robust in large or continuous tasks, localizing where the agent can still learn effectively (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009).
3. Hybrid Impact Measure
   - Drawing on prior work (Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020), the agent obtains a bonus for effecting changes in the learned state embedding. This "impact-driven" term remains meaningful even after forward-model predictions become accurate, thus sustaining curiosity in discoverable subregions.
4. Stability in Sparse Rewards
   - Many curiosity algorithms degrade in tasks where extrinsic rewards are extremely sparse or partial (Burda et al., 2018). By combining learning progress and controllability checks, the proposed method better retains consistent exploration signals, especially in procedurally-generated environments or partially observed robotics domains.
5. Reduced Sensitivity to "Noisy TV"
   - Because subregions with purely random transitions show no sustained reduction in prediction error, they yield near-zero learning progress. This avoids persistent agent "interest" in random distractors (cf. Pathak et al., 2019).

In summary, the proposed approach unifies region-based learning progress (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009) with an impact-driven embedding measure (Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020), explicitly filtering subspaces containing partial randomness. This ensures sustained, meaningful exploration across complex or procedural domains, where prior novelty- or error-based methods often stall or chase noise-laden transitions.
