### 3.4 Competence-Based and Skill Discovery Approaches

Competence-based exploration frames learning as an agent’s pursuit of **mastery** over self-generated tasks (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007). Instead of solely seeking novel or unpredictable states (cf. knowledge-based methods in Section 2.1), the agent intrinsically rewards itself for **improving** its competence in reaching goals or performing skills. By actively choosing “just-right” challenges or tasks, competence-based methods can systematically guide exploration even in **partially random** environments (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009). This section examines the fundamental mathematical principles, notable algorithms, and recent developments merging competence-based exploration with **skill discovery** frameworks.
