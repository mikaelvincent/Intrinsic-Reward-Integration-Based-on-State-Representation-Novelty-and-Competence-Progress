### 2.3 The "Noisy TV" Problem and Partially Random Environments

A hallmark of curiosity-based approaches is their vulnerability to uncontrollable environment stochasticity, sometimes called the "noisy TV" problem (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018). When transitions are irreducibly random, pure novelty- or prediction-error-based rewards may continue to rank these transitions as "interesting," causing the agent to waste time in random subregions. Various works address this by distinguishing between controllable vs. uncontrolled variations (Frank et al., 2014; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). For example, some research attempts to model aleatoric uncertainty to remove irreducibly random signals from the agent's intrinsic reward (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). Others rely on "impact-driven" or "state-change-based" rewards (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020), discounting transitions that reflect purely stochastic changes rather than agent-induced effects.

Procedurally generated environments (Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2023) amplify this challenge, since states rarely repeat identically across episodes, undermining simple state-visit metrics or tabular counts (Bellemare et al., 2016). Impact-driven methods (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020) and ensemble disagreement (Pathak et al., 2019) remain active fronts for building robust exploration in such complex or partially random tasks.
