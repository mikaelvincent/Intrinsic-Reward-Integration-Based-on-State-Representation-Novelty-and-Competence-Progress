### 2.5 Pseudo-Counts and Density-Based Novelty

An influential thread of research connected count-based exploration with intrinsic motivation via pseudo-counts. According to (Bellemare et al., 2016), a generative model \(\rho\) can quantify how "familiar" a state is based on its probability under \(\rho\). When the agent encounters a state that markedly increases the model's assigned probability, a pseudo-count increment is computed. This increment, in turn, influences a standard count-based bonus \(\propto [N_n(s)]^{-1/2}\). Pseudo-counts thus extend tabular count-based methods to high-dimensional or image-based states by using density estimation. Over time, states recognized as irreducibly noisy will yield negligible increments in pseudo-counts, preventing the agent from repeatedly exploring purely random subregions.
