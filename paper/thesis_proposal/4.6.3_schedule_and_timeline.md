#### 4.6.3 Schedule and Timeline

The project requires systematic progression across literature review, methodological development, experiments, analysis, and final documentation. Minor adjustments may occur depending on intermediate results and resource availability.

1. Weeks 1-8: Preliminary Research and Planning
   - Conduct an initial literature scan to refine problem scope, focusing on partially random reinforcement learning tasks.
   - Identify software tools and libraries for experimentation and finalize environment selection.
   - Confirm the initial set of baseline methods to be integrated.

2. Week 9-16: Extended Literature Review and Proposal Refinement
   - Deepen the literature survey with emphasis on existing intrinsic motivation frameworks and partial randomness handling.
   - Align the final statement of the problem and refine the research objectives based on emerging insights.
   - Complete an initial detailed outline of methodological steps to be implemented.

3. Week 17: Baseline Implementations
   - Implement and validate baseline reinforcement learning algorithms in selected environments.
   - Verify correctness and collect preliminary performance metrics under varied environment settings.

4. Week 18: Proposed Approach Development
   - Implement the multi-component intrinsic reward framework, integrating partial-randomness filtering and learning progress signals.
   - Ensure correctness by cross-comparison with known approaches in controlled scenarios.

5. Week 19: Pilot Experiments and Parameter Tuning
   - Conduct small-scale tests on simpler tasks to tune hyperparameters.
   - Gather initial results that guide final hyperparameter ranges and execution budgets for full-scale experiments.

6. Week 20: Full Experimental Runs
   - Execute experiments on the main environments, covering multiple seeds for statistical significance.
   - Collect performance metrics, learning curves, and relevant logs for both baseline and proposed methods.
   - Continuously monitor resource usage and potential system constraints.

7. Week 21: Data Analysis and Method Refinement
   - Process experimental logs, generate visualizations, and perform statistical analyses.
   - Identify any performance anomalies or technical limitations; refine the approach if needed.

8. Week 23: Comparative Analysis and Final Experiments
   - Integrate lessons from preliminary analysis into final comparison with additional or updated baselines if necessary.
   - Finalize experiments on extended tasks.

9. Week 24: Final Data Consolidation and Thesis Writing
   - Consolidate final experimental results and unify them into conclusive tables, charts, and discussion.
   - Draft and refine the concluding sections, including limitations, potential future directions, and overall significance.

10. Week 25: Thesis Compilation and Review
    - Prepare the final thesis manuscript.
    - Conduct internal reviews or mock defenses, address possible gaps, and ensure cohesive presentation throughout.
    - Complete all formal requirements for submission.

This timeline encourages iterative refinement, allowing methodological adaptations as new insights arise. The final scheduling details are kept flexible to account for computation times and unforeseen implementation complexities.
