#### 4.1.2 Architecture and Algorithmic Steps

This section presents the structural components and iterative steps used by the proposed method. It outlines how the agent constructs state embeddings, tracks model errors, and calculates intrinsic rewards, ensuring that exploration remains directed toward learnable dynamics.
