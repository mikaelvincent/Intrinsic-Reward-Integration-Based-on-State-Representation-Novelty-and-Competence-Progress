##### 3.3.2.2 Subtracting Predicted Noise
To address partial randomness directly, Mavor-Parker et al. (2021) propose *aleatoric uncertainty estimation*. A forward model predicts both a mean \(\hat{\mu}_{t+1}\) and a covariance \(\hat{\Sigma}_{t+1}\). The intrinsic bonus is the *residual* error after subtracting \(\mathrm{Tr}(\hat{\Sigma}_{t+1})\). In other words:
\[
r_t^i
\;=\;
\bigl\|\,s_{t+1}-\hat{\mu}_{t+1}\bigr\|^2
\;-\;
\eta\;\mathrm{Tr}\!\bigl(\hat{\Sigma}_{t+1}\bigr),
\]
where \(\eta\) is a scaling factor (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). This ensures that states or transitions recognized as “inherently random” no longer yield sustained curiosity, mitigating indefinite focus on noise.
