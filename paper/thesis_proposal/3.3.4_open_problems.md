#### 3.3.4 Open Problems

- Long-Horizon Dependencies
  - Many methods focus on short-term novelty or immediate information gain, risking suboptimal coverage of partially random tasks with multi-step planning requirements (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019). Future research might integrate hierarchical or model-based planning to identify distant controllable subregions.
- Effective Noise Calibration
  - Aleatoric uncertainty estimation (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021) or ensemble disagreement (Pathak et al., 2019) can reduce random-state loops, yet robust calibration across large, visually complex tasks remains nontrivial.
- State Abstraction and Representation
  - High-dimensional inputs often conflate random aspects (e.g., background flickers) with meaningful state features (Bellemare et al., 2016). Designing or learning representations that highlight controllable transitions but ignore random distractors (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007) is key.
- Scalability and Real-World Noise
  - Real-world robotics can exhibit partial randomness from sensor drift or environment perturbations. Methods like competence-based exploration (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009) or skill-discovery approaches (Achiam et al., 2018; Eysenbach et al., 2018) might help the agent focus on mastering physically relevant modes while discounting unpredictable interference.
