#### 3.4.6 Research Directions and Open Challenges

1. **Hierarchical Composition of Skills**:  
   Many competence-based methods produce a suite of “mastered” behaviors. Integrating them in a hierarchical policy could tackle more complex tasks. However, stable composition remains nontrivial when random transitions disrupt sub-skill chaining.

2. **Adaptive Goal Spaces**:  
   Defining or learning the goal space \(\mathcal{G}\) is often as important as the competence-based reward. New approaches use representation learning to discover subgoal embeddings (Han et al., 2019), or combine knowledge-based signals with competence-based signals for robust exploration (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).

3. **Scalability and Real-World Embodiment**:  
   While competence-based exploration is promising for robotics, controlling high-dimensional arms or humanoids under partial randomness (Frank et al., 2014) requires advanced function approximators and carefully tuned progress metrics. Ongoing research explores combining these methods with ensemble-based or Bayesian approaches to discount unpredictable noise further.

4. **Skill Transfer and Lifelong Learning**:  
   Once the agent masters subgoals or distinct skills, how can it transfer them to subsequent tasks? Approaches like re-labeling transitions as accomplished subgoals or hierarchical scheduling remain active areas for partially random or ever-changing domains (Achiam et al., 2018; Eysenbach et al., 2018).
