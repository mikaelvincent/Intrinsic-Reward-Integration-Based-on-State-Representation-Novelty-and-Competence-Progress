##### 4.02.1.1 Procedurally Generated and Partially Random Tasks

To capture a broad spectrum of partially random scenarios, we adopt the following tasks:
- MiniGrid and Key-Based Mazes
  - We use the MiniGrid suite, specifically tasks such as MultiRoom-N or KeyCorridorS variants (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020). These tasks exhibit partial randomness in room connections, key placements, or obstructed doors.
  - Each episode randomly samples a new layout, ensuring states rarely repeat exactly (Bellemare et al., 2016), thus preventing naive state-count exploration from saturating too quickly.
  - The agent interacts in a 2D grid, collecting transitions of the form \((s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_t)\) for a maximum horizon or until success/failure.
- Procgen Benchmarks
  - We also employ selected Procgen tasks such as CoinRun, Heist, or Climber, which generate novel platformer or maze-like settings each episode (Cobbe et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021).
  - State spaces can be visually high-dimensional (RGB frames), and environment transitions contain action-based partial randomness. This amplifies the agent’s need for robust, curiosity-driven exploration (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).
- Continuous-Action Control
  - Certain experiments (e.g., Swimmer or HalfCheetah with injected partial random friction/wind) will be tested to confirm the method’s scalability to high-dimensional continuous states and actions (Houthooft et al., 2016; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
  - We incorporate environment wrappers that apply random external forces or sensor noise to partially randomize transitions, verifying how the agent’s exploration is influenced by irreducible stochasticity.
 
Each environment instantiates partial randomness differently:
- MiniGrid or Procgen randomize level geometry.
- MuJoCo-based tasks apply random forces.

Collectively, these configurations generate a broad, challenging dataset of transitions for the agent to explore (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007; Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018).
