### 4.3 Environments

These environments collectively span discrete vs. continuous actions, low- vs. high-dimensional states, image vs. numeric observations, and varying degrees of partial randomness. Their diversity facilitates a thorough evaluation of the proposed exploration framework and baseline methods. The primary limiting factor in selecting these domains was the estimated computational and time costs for training, ensuring that all experiments could be conducted within practical resource constraints.
