#### 4.10.5 Cross-Validation and Statistical Significance

By employing repeated runs, robust sampling, and formal significance tests, we intend to:
- Multiple Runs
  - Repeated training with 5–10 seeds per environment to compute means and confidence intervals (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020).
- Paired Tests
  - Use random seeds as pairs across methods (Pathak et al., 2019).
- Significance Analysis
  - For final performance, apply ANOVA or non-parametric (e.g., Wilcoxon test) to check differences (Ladosz et al., 2022).
