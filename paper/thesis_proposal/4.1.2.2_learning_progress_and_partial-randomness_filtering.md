##### 4.1.2.2 Learning Progress and Partial-Randomness Filtering

Each subregion $R_i$ monitors forward-model error over repeated visits. A local measure of learning progress $\mathrm{LP}_i$ is computed as the drop in average prediction error across updates:
$$
\mathrm{LP}_i 
= \max\{\,0,\;\overline{E}_i^\mathrm{(old)} - \overline{E}_i^\mathrm{(new)}\}.
$$

When a subregion's error decreases significantly, it indicates that the region is learnable and should continue attracting exploration. If the model's error remains persistently high, the region is flagged as having unlearnable or random transitions. The agent's intrinsic reward for transitions in such a region is reduced toward zero, preventing infinite curiosity loops in irreducibly noisy subareas.
