##### 4.4.2.2 Learning Progress and Partial-Randomness Filtering

1. Learning Progress Computation
   - $$
       \mathrm{LP}_i 
       = \max\{\,0,\;\overline{E}_i^\mathrm{(old)} - \overline{E}_i^\mathrm{(new)}\}.
     $$
     A positive value means the local model improved, implying the subregion is (at least partially) learnable. A near-zero or negative $\mathrm{LP}_i$ signals that repeated samples do not reduce error, indicating random factors.
2. Filtering Mechanism
   - If subregion $R_i$ is flagged as unlearnable (prolonged high error or negligible learning progress), subsequent transitions are assigned a near-zero intrinsic reward.
   - If $\mathrm{LP}_i$ remains significantly positive, subregion visits yield a higher learning-progress bonus.
