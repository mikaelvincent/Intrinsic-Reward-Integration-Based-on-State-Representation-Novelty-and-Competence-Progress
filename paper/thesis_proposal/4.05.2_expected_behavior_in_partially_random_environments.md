#### 4.05.2 Expected Behavior in Partially Random Environments

When applying multiple curiosity signals, we expect the following behaviors in partially random domains:
- Noisy Subregions
  - EBIG and ANAPE both yield low net curiosity signals once the agent realizes transitions are random.
  - CBSP also yields low improvement if skill mastery cannot be furthered in that subregion.
  - Together, these signals push the agent away from purely stochastic loops.
- Controllable Subregions
  - EBIG remains positive if the agent’s ensemble still has partial epistemic uncertainty.
  - ANAPE yields a moderate raw error if the agent visits novel but learnable states, minus any small predicted variance.
  - CBSP becomes large if the agent can incrementally reduce the skill error in that region.
  - The agent invests time here until diminishing returns appear.
- Long-Horizon Goals
  - If competence-based sub-goals are discoverable, the agent can systematically chain simpler skill mastery steps into more complex achievements (Gregor et al., 2016).
  - The knowledge-based signals remain helpful for local coverage, but CBSP fosters “developmental” exploration phases typical of advanced curiosity frameworks (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).
