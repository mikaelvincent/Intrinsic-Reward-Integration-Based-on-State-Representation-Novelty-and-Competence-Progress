### 2.9 Integrating Learned Skills with Downstream Tasks

Once skills or options are learned through intrinsic objectives, they can be leveraged to expedite tasks that introduce extrinsic rewards. For instance, a variational approach by (Achiam et al., 2018) unifies autoencoding perspectives of options, training a decoder to infer which latent context generated a trajectory. By discovering a range of distinct options, the agent can more rapidly adapt if an extrinsic goal is specified later. However, as reported, purely information-based methods may require additional constraints or shaping to handle highly random or high-dimensional continuous environments effectively.
