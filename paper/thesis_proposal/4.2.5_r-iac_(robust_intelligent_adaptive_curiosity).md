#### 4.2.5 R-IAC (Robust Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity)

R-IAC (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009) divides the state-action space into local subregions and observes how model prediction error decreases within each region. The agent prioritizes subregions where the learning progress (i.e., reduction in error) remains substantial, thereby concentrating on transitions that can still improve forward-model accuracy. This avoids devoting extensive effort to fully random, unlearnable regimes and subregions already mastered. R-IAC has been shown to facilitate effective exploration in spaces that include trivial and irreducibly noisy segments.
