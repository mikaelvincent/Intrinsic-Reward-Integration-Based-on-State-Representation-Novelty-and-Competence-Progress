#### 3.3.3 Toward a Formal Treatment of Partial Randomness

Mathematically, let \(\zeta \subset \mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\) represent transitions with high aleatoric variance, i.e. the environment’s “random subspace.” One can define an *extended transition distribution*:
\[
P(s_{t+1}\mid s_t,a_t)
\;=\;
\int
\Bigl(
  p_{\mathrm{learn}}(s_{t+1}\mid s_t,a_t,\nu)
  \;+\;
  \chi_{\zeta}(s_t,a_t)\,\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)
\Bigr)
\,\mathrm{d}\nu,
\]
where \(\chi_{\zeta}\) is an indicator function that is 1 only if \(\nu\) belongs to irreducibly random transitions. Any *epistemic* uncertainty in \(p_{\mathrm{learn}}\) can be reduced as the agent collects data, but the second (noise) component remains uncontrollable (Jarrett et al., 2022; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).  
From an *optimal exploration* standpoint, an agent’s policy \(\pi(a_t\mid s_t)\) must avoid devoting excessive exploration to \(\zeta\), as no update to its model or skill repertoire can reduce \(\sigma^2\) there (Houthooft et al., 2016). Conversely, ignoring \(\zeta\) altogether can miss partial knowledge or limited structure around the edges of random transitions. Balancing these extremes is the essence of robust curiosity in partially random domains.
