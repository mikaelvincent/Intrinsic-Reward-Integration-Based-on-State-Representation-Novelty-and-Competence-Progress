### 4.06 Development Model

This study adopts an iterative and incremental model for development. It balances early prototyping (to verify that our adaptive curiosity approach handles partial randomness) with structured phases to integrate, refine, and evaluate each exploration mechanism.

We begin with a proof-of-concept stage, creating minimal implementations of our three intrinsic signals—Bayesian ensemble information gain, aleatoric noise subtraction, and competence-based progress—then merging these in a straightforward, manually weighted manner. Following this initial viability test, we proceed in incremental cycles:
1. Design and Implementation Cycle
   - Add or refine specific sub-components in short sprints.
   - Draw on existing frameworks to accelerate development.
2. Integration Cycle
   - Combine components into a single agent, unifying the signals.
   - Reference literature to systematically align weighting strategies.
3. Testing Cycle
   - Evaluate partially on smaller tasks to ensure the agent avoids or discounts irreducible noise.
   - Gradually integrate more complex tasks to confirm robust exploration under partial randomness.

At each cycle, we gather user-like feedback (analyst observation or small-scale test logs) to see whether the agent exhibits stable performance and meaningful exploration. This iterative, incremental approach fosters ongoing refinements: new insights about environment randomization or agent–environment interactions feed back into design decisions, a hallmark of modern agile development. By continuously evaluating partial or emergent results, we ensure that pressing issues are surfaced and resolved before advanced tasks are tackled.
