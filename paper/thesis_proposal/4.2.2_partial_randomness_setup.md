#### 4.2.2 Partial Randomness Setup

In order to test exploration robustness under non-trivial environment variations, each domain is configured with partially random dynamics or layouts. Introducing random elements ensures that purely memorized strategies or single-seed tuning are insufficient (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Bellemare et al., 2016).

The main randomization strategies are as follows:
1. Random Seeding
   - Each environment is initialized with a random seed at the start of an episode, varying initial positions, velocities, or tasks. For Mountain Car and Bipedal Walker, this randomization can include small variations in start positions or link masses. Car Racing includes random track generation each episode, so the agent encounters different road layouts. 
2. Stochastic Dynamics
   - Certain transitions are given small random perturbations. In Bipedal Walker, a random wind or torque offset may be added. In Car Racing, friction or traction might fluctuate randomly. These ensure that repeated states do not always yield identical next states, testing an agent's ability to distinguish learnable transitions from noise.
3. Domain Randomization
   - For MuJoCo tasks (Ant, Half Cheetah, Humanoid), masses, friction coefficients, or joint damping parameters are sampled from distributions each episode (Todorov et al., 2012). This approach forces the agent to learn robust control strategies that generalize across a family of physically plausible variants.
4. Visual or Layout Perturbations
   - In Car Racing, track backgrounds, tile colors, or shapes can shift slightly. These cosmetic or moderate structural variations prevent reliance on purely memorized pixel patterns.

These partially random setups allow systematic evaluation of exploration methods that aim to distinguish irreducibly noisy events from learnable environment structures.
