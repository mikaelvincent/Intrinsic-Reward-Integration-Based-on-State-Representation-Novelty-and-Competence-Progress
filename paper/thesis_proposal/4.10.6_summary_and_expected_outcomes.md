#### 4.10.6 Summary and Expected Outcomes

By combining the tri-component curiosity signals (EBIG, ANAPE, CBSP) and validating them via controlled tasks, partial-random expansions, and complex procedural benchmarks, we aim to:
- Demonstrate robust avoidance of purely random transitions (the “noisy TV” effect) (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
- Show that EBIG fosters coverage in uncertain but learnable regions (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019).
- Confirm ANAPE effectively subtracts irreducible noise (Huang et al., 2021; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
- Prove CBSP fosters long-horizon skill acquisition (Achiam et al., 2018; Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).
- Provide evidence that adaptive weighting leads to stable, synergy-based exploration across partial randomness levels.

Collectively, these verification and testing procedures will ensure that our method is both theoretically grounded and empirically validated, culminating in stronger results on partially random RL tasks than single-signal or simpler curiosity approaches.
