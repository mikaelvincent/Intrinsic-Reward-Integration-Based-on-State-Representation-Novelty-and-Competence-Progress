### 4.7 Data Analysis and Results Interpretation

The post-processing and visualization framework is designed to convey both the overall trend of performance and the variability observed across multiple seeds. Data are aggregated and plotted according to standardized practices that reveal how each algorithm handles partial randomness or sparse reward conditions.

1. Learning Curves
   - Averaging and Smoothing
     - A rolling average window of 50 or 100 episodes is applied to episodic returns or other episodic-level metrics. For metrics logged at each time step (e.g., curiosity signals or forward-model errors), an exponential smoothing factor is used to reduce high-frequency noise while retaining the underlying trajectory of learning progress (Houthooft et al., 2016).
   - Confidence Intervals or Shading
     - Mean curves across random seeds are depicted with shaded regions representing \(\pm 1\) standard deviation or standard error. This approach indicates whether performance differences are consistent across seeds (Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020).
2. Statistical Significance
   - Aggregate Metrics
     - A fixed number of training steps serves as a reference point for collecting the final or near-asymptotic values of episodic returns or success rates. For each algorithm, the mean and standard deviation across seeds are reported. Pairwise significance tests (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum) determine whether one algorithm's average performance is statistically higher than another's beyond random variability (Pathak et al., 2017).
   - Confidence Bounds
     - When best or average returns are reported, 95% confidence intervals are included. If computational constraints limit the number of seeds, nonparametric approaches, such as bootstrapping within each seed's episodes, provide additional caution regarding the reliability of observed differences (Bellemare et al., 2016).
3. Subplots for Intrinsic Signals
   - Forward-Model Error
     - In order to illustrate the agent's adaptation to partially random transitions, forward-model errors over time are plotted. Plateaus in these curves indicate if a curiosity-based mechanism saturates in random or uncontrollable subregions (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009).
   - State-Visit Histograms
     - In certain discrete or low-dimensional tasks, 2D heatmaps of the agent's visited states help illustrate whether exploration thoroughly covers the environment or neglects large areas. Such coverage plots allow direct comparison of how effectively each algorithm explores partially random subregions (Raileanu and Rocktäschel, 2020).
4. Interpretation and Cross-Referencing
   Each figure is examined in the context of the environment's reward structure or randomization conditions. Stably low forward-model errors often signify that the proposed approach has effectively disregarded noise-driven transitions (Burda et al., 2018). If large variability appears among seeds, a deeper analysis—such as examining individual run logs or environment seeds—is conducted to identify factors contributing to divergent outcomes (Houthooft et al., 2016).

This methodology for data logging, plotting, and comparative statistical analysis offers both quantitative and qualitative insights into the reliability and robustness of exploration strategies, especially in environments featuring partial randomness or sparse extrinsic feedback.
