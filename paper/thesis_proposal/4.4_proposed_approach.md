### 4.4 Proposed Approach

This section outlines a new approach for intrinsically motivated exploration in environments where certain transitions are partially random or inherently stochastic.

The proposed method is designed to:
1. Identify and discount "unlearnable" or irreducibly random transitions that inflate curiosity-driven signals (a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the "noisy TV" problem, cf. Pathak et al., 2019).
2. Combine region-based learning progress with an embedded forward model and partial-randomness filtering, thus maintaining a robust curiosity mechanism even in large or continuous state-action spaces (cf. Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009; Bellemare et al., 2016; Raileanu and Rockt√§schel, 2020).
3. Sustain exploration in settings where typical novelty- or prediction-error-based methods lose effectiveness due to ephemeral random states that rarely repeat, such as procedurally generated levels or real robotic tasks with sensor noise (cf. Burda et al., 2018).
