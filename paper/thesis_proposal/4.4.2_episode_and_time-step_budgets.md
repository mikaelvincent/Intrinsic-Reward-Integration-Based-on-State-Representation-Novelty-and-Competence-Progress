#### 4.4.2 Episode and Time-Step Budgets

The agent uses the PPO-based approach until either the maximum step budget is reached or learning converges earlier. The ranges listed below will be refined after pilot experiments, ensuring that each environment sees sufficient exploration for policy improvement without excessive computational overhead.

- Mountain Car
  - Episodes terminate at 200 steps if the goal is not reached.
  - Total Step Range: 1 million to 2 million.
- Bipedal Walker
  - Each episode ends if the agent falls or completes the track (maximum 1600 steps).
  - Total Step Range: 2 million to 5 million.
- Car Racing
  - Episodes can last up to 2000 steps, terminating if off-track events persist or the lap is completed.
  - Total Step Range: 3 million to 8 million.
- Ant (MuJoCo)
  - Episodes terminate at 1000 steps or if the robot falls.
  - Total Step Range: 5 million to 10 million.
- Half Cheetah (MuJoCo)
  - Episodes typically run for 1000 steps unless the agent falls.
  - Total Step Range: 5 million to 10 million.
- Humanoid (MuJoCo)
  - Episodes typically last up to 1000 or 2000 steps.
  - Total Step Range: 10 million to 20 million.

Each environment ends training when reaching the specified limit or achieving clear convergence in performance metrics, whichever occurs first. The exact final step budgets for each environment will be chosen based on pilot results, balancing computational cost against thorough exploration of the environment's state-action space.
