#### 4.3.6 Humanoid

A high-dimensional humanoid robot with up to 17 torque-controlled joints, designed to test stable bipedal locomotion in 3D:
- States: Up to around 350 features, including body orientation, joint angles, velocities, and contact forces.
- Actions: 17 continuous torques, each mapped to a joint controlling limbs or torso.
- Reward: Primarily forward velocity plus a healthy posture term, minus control and contact costs. Episodes terminate if the robot's torso height is out of valid range or a time-step budget is reached.
- Partial Randomization: Each episode seeds the simulation with random inertial parameters or initial poses, necessitating robust motor strategies.
