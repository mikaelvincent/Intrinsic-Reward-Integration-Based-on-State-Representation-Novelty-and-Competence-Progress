### 4.09 Project Management

The project applies basic agile principles with short development sprints, dedicated testing milestones, and continuous integration of new findings. Our structure ensures accountability, adaptability, and clear documentation of tasks.

Key elements include:
- Sprint-Based
  - We organize 2-week sprints, each having clearly defined deliverables.
- Backlog and Boards
  - A simple Kanban or Trello-like board tracks tasks (reference for a discussion of balancing multiple signals).
- Meetings
  - Weekly check-ins to discuss partial results, next steps, or shifting priorities if new evidence emerges (similar to open-ended exploration processes).
- Milestones
  - Integration of each curiosity module,
  - Unified approach tested in simpler tasks,
  - Full approach tested in large tasks,
  - Final comparative evaluation.

Throughout, we maintain a shared code repository for standard RL components and specialized modules. This fosters collaboration and consistent versioning among participants.
