##### 3.3.2.4 Competence and Self-Generated Goals
Finally, competence-based approaches (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Eysenbach et al., 2018) discount worthless randomness by focusing on how *well* the agent masters self-defined goals or subgoals. Once random or unlearnable transitions yield no further competence gain, the agent naturally shifts exploration to other subregions (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009). “Diversity is All You Need” likewise learns *discriminable skill embeddings* (Eysenbach et al., 2018), ignoring ephemeral noise since such transitions cannot produce stable skill outcomes.
