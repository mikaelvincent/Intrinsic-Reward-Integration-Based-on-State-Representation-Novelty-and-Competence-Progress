#### 4.4.1 Hyperparameter Configuration

This section presents the hyperparameter settings used for the PPO algorithm and for both the proposed intrinsic reward approach and the baseline methods. Each hyperparameter is assigned a range of possible values, subject to refinement after initial trial experiments. These refinements ensure that each environment's dynamics, observation spaces, and computational constraints are addressed without prematurely fixing hyperparameters. All hyperparameters will be recorded precisely once the training runs are finalized.
