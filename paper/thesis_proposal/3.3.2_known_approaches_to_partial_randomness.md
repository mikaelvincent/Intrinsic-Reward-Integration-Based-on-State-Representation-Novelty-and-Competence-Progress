#### 3.3.2 Known Approaches to Partial Randomness

Partial randomness in an environment poses a fundamental challenge for exploration: purely prediction-based or novelty-centric methods often mistake irreducible noise for learnable uncertainty. This mismatch can lure agents into endlessly revisiting stochastic states (“noisy TVs”) that do not actually improve their model of the environment (see Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). Consequently, a variety of exploration algorithms have been designed to recognize and discount transitions that remain unpredictable or uncontrollable.
