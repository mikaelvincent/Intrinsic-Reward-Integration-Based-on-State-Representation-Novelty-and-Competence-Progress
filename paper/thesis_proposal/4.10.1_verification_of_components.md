#### 4.10.1 Verification of Components

By combining the tri-component curiosity signals (EBIG, ANAPE, CBSP) and verifying each subcomponent’s functionality under controlled conditions, we intend to:
- Ensemble Bayesian Information Gain (EBIG)
  - Objective
    - Confirm that the ensemble-based Bayesian posteriors (Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019) are updated properly and that the resulting KL divergence correctly reflects epistemic uncertainty in the learned dynamics.
  - Method
    - Posterior Convergence Checks
      - Periodically measure how the ensemble’s predictions converge to consistent mean predictions in truly random transitions (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
    - Diagnostic Transitions
      - Insert transitions with known deterministic vs. random outcomes, verifying that the agent’s intrinsic reward from EBIG is high only in the learnable—but currently uncertain—region, and near-zero for purely random transitions.
- Aleatoric Noise-Adjusted Prediction Error (ANAPE)
  - Objective
    - Test whether the forward-model predictions accurately estimate both a mean \(\hat{\mu}_{t+1}\) and variance \(\hat{\Sigma}_{t+1}\) to discount irreducible noise (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
  - Method
    - Noise Injection Experiments
      - In a controlled environment with synthetic random “noise” states, confirm that the term \(\eta \,\mathrm{Tr}(\hat{\Sigma}_{t+1})\) grows large for unlearnable transitions, reducing the net curiosity bonus.
    - Residual Analysis
      - Plot the raw prediction error \(\|\hat{\mu}_{t+1} - s_{t+1}\|\) alongside the predicted aleatoric variance \(\mathrm{Tr}(\hat{\Sigma}_{t+1})\). If the predicted variance correlates well with truly random transitions, it indicates correct noise modeling.
- Competence-Based Skill Progress (CBSP)
  - Objective
    - Confirm that the method for tracking competence gains in self-generated goals is implemented correctly, following the region-based approach of R-IAC (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009) or skill-discovery frameworks (Gregor et al., 2016; Eysenbach et al., 2018).
  - Method
    - Goal Regression Tests
      - For each identified subregion or subtask, measure how the agent’s skill accuracy evolves. Ensure the stored competence error reliably decreases when real learning occurs, and saturates in random or trivial regions.
    - Synthetic Skill Modules
      - Provide tasks with known “masterable” vs. “unmasterable” subgoals. Check that the CBSP module reports high learning progress for the masterable tasks and near-zero progress for random/unreachable subgoals (Achiam et al., 2018).
