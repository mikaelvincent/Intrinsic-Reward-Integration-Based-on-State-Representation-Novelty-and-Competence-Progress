#### 4.05.4 Limitations and Planned Mitigations

While our multi-signal framework provides robust exploration, several constraints remain to be addressed, such as:
- Overlapping or Redundant Signals
  - EBIG and ANAPE might occasionally highlight similar states. The adaptive weighting ensures that, if one signal dominates, the otherâ€™s weight can reduce.
- Complex Hyperparameter Tuning
  - We rely on dynamic weighting to reduce the burden.
  - Additional domain-specific pre-tests (e.g., small scale tasks) can further refine hyperparameters.
- Transition to Real-World Robotics
  - Real tasks add partial observability, sensor drift, and safety constraints. We plan to first validate in simulation, then investigate potential safe-exploration augmentations.
