#### 4.01.1 Overview of Environment Requirements

Our overall goal is to evaluate how adaptive curiosity mechanisms—particularly those handling partially random transitions—impact exploration and learning performance (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Ladosz et al., 2022; Mazzaglia et al., 2021). We therefore seek environments that:
- Feature diverse forms of partial randomness in their layouts, object placements, or transitions (Jarrett et al., 2022; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021).
- Support procedural generation to ensure that exact states rarely repeat, mirroring real-world complexity (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020; Sekar et al., 2020).
- Permit systematic measurement of exploration coverage, skill acquisition, and resilience to noise (Eysenbach et al., 2018; Frank et al., 2014).

We include both grid-based and continuous-control tasks to confirm that observed phenomena generalize across state and action space representations (Peters & Schaal, 2008; Ostrovski et al., 2017; Houthooft et al., 2016).
