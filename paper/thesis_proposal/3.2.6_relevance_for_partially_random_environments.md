#### 3.2.6 Relevance for Partially Random Environments

In partially random or procedurally generated scenarios, naive novelty or forward errors may dwell in irreducibly noisy areas. Approaches that factor out aleatoric uncertainty (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021) or discount saturating states (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018) remain essential. Combining multiple signals (Huang et al., 2021) or adopting competence-based transitions (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009) can further mitigate random-state loops while steadily pushing the agent’s coverage of learnable transitions. As seen in advanced frameworks like RIDE (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020) or Plan2Explore (Sekar et al., 2020), robust curiosity relies on carefully distinguishing “informative novelty” from “noise-driven novelty,” ensuring an adaptive exploration strategy that fosters systematic skill acquisition in dynamic, partially stochastic worlds.
