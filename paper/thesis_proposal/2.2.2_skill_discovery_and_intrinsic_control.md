#### 2.2.2 Skill Discovery and Intrinsic Control

Competence-based ideas also connect to skill discovery frameworks, wherein an agent learns diverse “options” or “policies” that enable reliable transitions to targeted states or outcomes. Rather than only exploring for novelty, these methods cultivate a repertoire of masterable skills—each reflecting a form of “competence” in achieving its designated sub-goal. Several influential approaches include:
- Variational Intrinsic Control (VIC)
  - A pioneering work introduced VIC, which maximizes the mutual information between a skill label and the final state under that skill’s policy (Gregor et al., 2016). Although VIC focuses on knowledge-based signals (the agent tries to ensure each skill leads to a uniquely identifiable outcome), it also embodies aspects of competence: each discovered skill must be reliable enough to reach or maintain its characteristic state.
- Diversity is All You Need (DIAYN)
  - Another method, DIAYN (Eysenbach et al., 2018), seeks a broad array of skills by maximizing the distinguishability of state visitation patterns for each latent skill. While DIAYN is often presented as a “diversity-based” or “information-based” approach, it effectively produces robust, competent policies that can control different modes of the environment (e.g., directional locomotion skills).
- Variational Option Discovery (VALOR)
  - An extension of these ideas explores a general variational autoencoding perspective: the policy encodes a context, and a decoder tries to recover which context generated the observed trajectory (Achiam et al., 2018). As the agent refines these “options” to produce trajectories that are confidently distinguishable, it gains competence in enacting each option. Although not explicitly labeled “competence-based,” these frameworks often converge upon skill sets where each skill reliably achieves distinct outcomes—functionally parallel to competence-based goals.
