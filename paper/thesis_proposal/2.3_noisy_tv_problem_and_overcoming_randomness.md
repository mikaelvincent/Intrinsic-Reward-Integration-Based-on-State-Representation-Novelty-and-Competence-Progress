### 2.3 Noisy TV Problem and Overcoming Randomness

An oft-cited challenge is the so-called "noisy TV" problem, in which purely stochastic state transitions can lead naive novelty-based curiosity methods to linger indefinitely. This issue has spurred research into exploration signals that explicitly discount or identify irreducible noise. One approach is ensemble disagreement, summarized by (Pathak et al., 2019), wherein an agent trains multiple predictive models and measures their variance as the exploration bonus. Because purely random transitions yield consistent prediction errors across all ensemble members, the overall disagreement bonus eventually vanishes in inherently stochastic areas, mitigating infinite exploration loops.

Another approach is aleatoric uncertainty modeling, as discussed by (Mavor-Parker et al., 2021). By modeling the environment's fundamental randomness, the agent avoids attributing high intrinsic rewards to unlearnable subregions of the state space. Modeling aleatoric uncertainty can thus preserve curiosity for controllable aspects while preventing the agent from fixating on noise-driven state changes.

Meanwhile, (Burda et al., 2018) presented Random Network Distillation (RND), a technique in which a randomly initialized target network provides a stable feature representation, and a predictor network is trained to match these features. States that remain poorly predicted receive higher intrinsic rewards. However, if the environment is dominated by partial randomness, RND alone may struggle to fully discount uncontrollable transitions.
