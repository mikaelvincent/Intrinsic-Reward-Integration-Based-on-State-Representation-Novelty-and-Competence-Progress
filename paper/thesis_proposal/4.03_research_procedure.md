### 4.03 Research Procedure

This section details the overall research procedure, consolidating our chosen environments, proposed adaptive curiosity mechanisms, experimental flows, and validation strategies. Our primary aim is to systematically test how adaptive curiosity methods—particularly those capable of recognizing and discounting partially random transitions—enhance exploration and learning performance in sparse-reward or procedurally generated settings.
