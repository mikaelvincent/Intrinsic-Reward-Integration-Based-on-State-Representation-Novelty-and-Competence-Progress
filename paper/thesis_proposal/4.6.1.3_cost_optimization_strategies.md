##### 4.6.1.3 Cost Optimization Strategies

- Spot (Preemptible) Instances
  - Whenever appropriate, spot VMs are employed to reduce hourly rates. Regular checkpointing ensures minimal data loss if a VM is reclaimed.
- Right-Sizing Resources
  - Each environment uses a VM with specifications matched to its computational demands. GPU resources are reserved primarily for environments that benefit from accelerated training (e.g., Car Racing).
- Sequential Scheduling
  - Experiments are run in sequence on the same instances to avoid idle periods. Automated scripts shut down VMs as soon as training completes, preventing unnecessary costs.
