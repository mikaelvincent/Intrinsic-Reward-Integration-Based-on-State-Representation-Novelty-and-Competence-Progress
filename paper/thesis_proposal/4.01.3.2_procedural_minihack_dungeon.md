##### 4.01.3.2 Procedural MiniHack Dungeon

We also plan to adapt a miniature “dungeon” setting akin to the MiniHack expansions, a grid-based but continuous-action environment. Each episode randomizes:
- Map topography (rooms, corridors, doors).
- Item placements (keys, potions, or worthless “noisy” items).
- Slightly randomized monster behaviors.

Similar approaches have been tested in advanced curiosity studies (Raileanu & Rocktäschel, 2020; Jarrett et al., 2022). The partial randomness ensures each run is unique, preventing naive memorization and requiring robust adaptive curiosity (Burda, Edwards, Pathak, et al., 2018).
