### 4.10 Verification, Validation, and Testing

Ensuring that our proposed multi-signal intrinsic reward framework is robust and effective under partially random conditions requires a comprehensive verification, validation, and testing strategy. This section presents the procedures we will follow to confirm the correctness of each component, validate performance in controlled settings, and compare against established baselines. We draw insights from earlier works on verification in curiosity-driven exploration (Bellemare et al., 2016; Houthooft et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2019; Mavor-Parker et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021), as well as skill discovery and competence-based testing (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Gregor et al., 2016; Eysenbach et al., 2018; Achiam et al., 2018).
