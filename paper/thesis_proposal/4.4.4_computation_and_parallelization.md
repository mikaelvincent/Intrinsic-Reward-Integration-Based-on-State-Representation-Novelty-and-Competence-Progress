#### 4.4.4 Computation and Parallelization

The final hardware setup per environment is recorded once runs begin. Typical expectations are:
- CPU Cores
  - 8–16 cores for standard runs; up to 32–64 cores if available for large-scale tasks like Humanoid.
- GPU
  - 1–2 GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3000 series or equivalent) handle neural network forward/backward passes.
  - If tasks have image-based states (e.g., Car Racing), GPU usage increases significantly.
- Parallel Environments
  - Typically 8–32 environment instances are launched. Each environment runs in a separate process, feeding data into a central queue.

If HPC or cluster resources are employed, extended parallelization can reduce total runtime. The specifics are reported once final runs are done.
