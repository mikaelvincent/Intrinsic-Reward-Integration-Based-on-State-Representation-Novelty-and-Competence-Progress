##### 3.3.2.1 Bayesian and Ensemble-Based Methods

Approaches like **VIME** (Houthooft et al., 2016) maintain a Bayesian neural network for environment dynamics; the agent’s *intrinsic reward* is the KL divergence of the network parameters’ posterior update after each transition. Once the model concludes that certain transitions reflect irreducible noise, the posterior update from such transitions becomes negligible, thus the intrinsic bonus in purely random regions decays over time (Houthooft et al., 2016). Similarly, **ensemble disagreement** fosters exploration only where *epistemic* uncertainty is high, ignoring *aleatoric* randomness after the ensemble converges to the same uncertain (or average) prediction (Pathak et al., 2019). Concretely, if each forward model \(f_i\) in the ensemble predicts \(\hat{s}_{t+1}^{(i)}\), then the disagreement-based curiosity is:
\[
r^i_t
\;=\;
\mathrm{Var}_i\bigl[\hat{s}_{t+1}^{(i)}\bigr],
\]
which saturates to near-zero once the agent recognizes a region as uncontrollably random (Pathak et al., 2019).
