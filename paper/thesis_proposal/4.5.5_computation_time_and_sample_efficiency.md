#### 4.5.5 Computation Time and Sample Efficiency

To ascertain practical viability, training duration and sample efficiency are measured:
- Wall-Clock Time
  - The elapsed time from the start to the completion of training is recorded. 
  - This measure indicates the computational overhead required to achieve a certain level of performance.
- Sample Efficiency
  - The cumulative environment steps used to reach a specified performance threshold is collected. 
  - Agents requiring fewer interactions to achieve comparable performance are deemed more sample-efficient, a critical factor for tasks with costly simulation or real-time robotics.
- Hardware Configuration
  - Details such as CPU/GPU specifications and the number of parallel environment rollouts are noted. 
  - Reporting these details clarifies how runtime might scale if different computational resources are used.

Collectively, these measurements provide evidence of whether a given approach is not only effective in final performance but also computationally feasible in more demanding or real-world scenarios.
