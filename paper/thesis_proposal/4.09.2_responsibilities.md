#### 4.09.2 Responsibilities

All tasks are performed collaboratively by Guirnela and Tumampos. Each has experience in Python-based RL frameworks, Bayesian ensemble training, and research presentation. They will share the following responsibilities equally:
- Literature Review and Related Work
  - Searching references on hybrid intrinsic rewards.
  - Summarizing key findings to guide design choices.
- Implementation of Individual Modules
  - Bayesian ensemble for epistemic uncertainty.
  - Aleatoric noise subtraction approach.
  - Competence-based progress tracking.
- Adaptive Weighting Logic
  - Designing policy-/distribution-aware weighting.
  - Integrating them into a single RL agent.
- Experimentation and Debugging
  - Setting up partially random tasks.
  - Conducting iterative tests, hyperparameter tuning, and large-scale runs.
- Evaluation and Analysis
  - Gathering metrics.
  - Running baseline comparisons.
  - Plotting and interpreting learning curves.
- Writing Thesis Sections
  - Documenting methodology, results, and discussion.
  - Producing final integrated text for each milestone.

In effect, Guirnela and Tumampos collaborate on all tasks to facilitate knowledge sharing and ensure consistent progress.
