### 4.07 Development Approaches

We blend agile software principles (short sprints, iterative improvements) with a research-driven experimentation flow. The approach is iterative rather than strictly linear, given the exploratory nature of designing intrinsic-motivation-based agents in partially random reinforcement learning (RL) contexts. Specifically:
- Agile-Like Sprints
  - Each sprint addresses a core question or milestone:
  - Work is broken down into tasks that fit within 1â€“2 week sprints, culminating in testable increments.
- Experimentation-Driven Refinement
  - Emphasize small, targeted experiments with immediate feedback, referencing prior successful curiosity methods.
  - Each experiment aims to confirm or disprove a hypothesis.
- Incremental Integration
  - Start with simpler tasks.
  - Integrate each intrinsic reward module in isolation, confirm partial success, then unify them.
  - Transfer to large, stochastically generated tasks only after stable performance is reached in earlier phases.
- Frequent Validation
  - Compare with known baselines monthly or bi-monthly.
  - Track not only extrinsic return but also coverage metrics, random-state dwell time, and ablations.
  - Adjust design choices based on empirical evidence.

Through this combined approach, we maintain a flexible method to adopt new insights or adapt to issues discovered mid-development, ensuring the final system robustly handles partial environment randomness in a timely and well-structured manner.
