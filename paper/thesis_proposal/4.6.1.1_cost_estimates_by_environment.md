##### 4.6.1.1 Cost Estimates by Environment

- Mountain Car
  - Compute: Utilizes a small 4-core CPU virtual machine (VM) with no GPU requirement. Each training run is expected to complete in approximately two hours. Multiple runs cumulatively demand around 10 compute hours at roughly ₱10 per hour, leading to an estimated ₱100 total cost.
  - Storage: Minimal, with only a few megabytes required for logs.
- Bipedal Walker
  - Compute: Runs efficiently on a CPU-only VM. Each run takes around four hours, totaling about 36 CPU hours across multiple seeds. At approximately ₱10 per hour, the projected cost is ₱400.
  - Storage: Negligible (<1 GB for checkpoint data and logs).
- Car Racing
  - Compute: Requires a GPU-enabled instance due to image-based observations. A mid-range NVIDIA T4 GPU VM (~₱30 per hour) typically trains for up to 24 hours per run. Multiple runs over about 216 GPU hours sum to ₱12,000 in compute costs.
  - Storage: Each run uses approximately 5–10 GB (model checkpoints and occasional rendered frames), incurring only minor storage fees.
- Ant
  - Compute: Uses a higher-end CPU instance to manage physics-based simulation. Each run averages 12 hours; with an estimated 108 CPU hours total at roughly ₱10 per hour, costs reach ₱1,100.
  - Storage: Small (<5 GB) for saving logs and intermediate artifacts.
- Half Cheetah
  - Compute: Similar to Ant, CPU-only VMs support the physics simulation. Each run requires around eight hours, with \~72 CPU hours total at ₱10 per hour, leading to ₱800 in compute costs.
  - Storage: Small, typically under a few gigabytes.
- Humanoid
  - Compute: Represents the most computationally demanding environment. Each run can span one to two days on a 16-core CPU VM, totaling around 432 CPU hours over multiple seeds. At ₱10 per hour, the expense is about ₱5,000.
  - Storage: Approximately 5–10 GB per run for checkpoints and logs.

Overall, the total budget allocation for compute across all environments is approximately ₱20,000, with Car Racing and Humanoid incurring the largest shares due to elevated simulation and training demands.
