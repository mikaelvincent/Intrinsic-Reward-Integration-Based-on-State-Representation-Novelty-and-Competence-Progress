### 2.1 Early Definitions and Typologies

Intrinsic motivation was originally discussed in psychology to describe actions undertaken for inherent satisfaction rather than external rewards. A seminal exploration of how to translate these psychological concepts into computational terms is presented by (Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2007). That work introduced a typology distinguishing knowledge-based, competence-based, and morphological approaches to intrinsic motivation. In knowledge-based approaches, internal reward signals often revolve around novelty or surprise; in competence-based approaches, intrinsic reward stems from improvements in accomplishing self-chosen goals; and morphological approaches focus on direct properties of the sensorimotor stream such as correlation or variance. This overarching classification set the stage for subsequent curiosity-driven methods in reinforcement learning (RL).
