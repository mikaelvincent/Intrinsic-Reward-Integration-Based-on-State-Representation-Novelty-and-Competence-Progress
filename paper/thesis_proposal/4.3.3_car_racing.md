#### 4.3.3 Car Racing

A top-down racing environment requiring the agent to control steering, acceleration, and braking on procedurally generated tracks:
- States: RGB frames of size $96 \times 96$ from a top-down camera.
- Actions: Either three continuous dimensions $\{\text{steer}, \text{gas}, \text{brake}\}$ or a discrete set of steering/braking combinations.
- Reward: A small negative reward per timestep, partial bonuses for visiting new road tiles, and a penalty for going off-track.
- Partial Randomization: Track layouts, tile colors, or friction are varied each episode, preventing purely memorized policies.
