##### 4.01.3.1 Maze Navigation in 2D

Inspired by widely used 2D navigation tasks (Huang et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2019), we design:
- A maze with walls arranged randomly in each episode, forming different corridors and dead-ends.
- Partial random transitions: each step has a small probability of random directional slippage, so the agent’s motion is not fully deterministic (Gregor et al., 2016; Kakade, 2001).
- The agent’s final aim is to reach a specific goal region. However, reward shaping is minimal, so the agent must rely heavily on intrinsic exploration bonuses (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009).
