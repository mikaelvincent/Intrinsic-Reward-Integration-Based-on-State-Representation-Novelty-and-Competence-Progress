#### 4.5.1 Episode and Time-Step Budgets

All experiments are run with a maximum step budget or episode budget per environment, following reference guidelines for reproducible benchmarking in large-scale or sparse-reward tasks (Bellemare et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017). 

Specifically:
- Mountain Car: up to 1 million steps.
- Bipedal Walker: up to 2 million steps.
- Car Racing: up to 3 million steps.
- Ant (MuJoCo): up to 5 million steps.
- Half Cheetah (MuJoCo): up to 5 million steps.
- Humanoid (MuJoCo): up to 10 million steps.

In each environment:
1. An episode terminates upon reaching the environment's goal condition (if any) or on hitting the maximum number of allowed steps (or time steps).
2. The training loop runs until the agent reaches the allocated total step budget. Throughout training, metrics are logged and the agent's policy periodically evaluated.
