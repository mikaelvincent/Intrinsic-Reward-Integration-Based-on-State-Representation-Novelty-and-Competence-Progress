#### 4.5.1 Evaluation Intervals and Procedures

To capture the progression of learning over time, periodic evaluations are scheduled. After a specified number of environment steps (e.g., every 50k or 100k timesteps), the training process is paused, and the current policy is subjected to a series of evaluation episodes. These episodes are designed to measure performance in the absence of additional exploration biases; thus, intrinsic rewards are excluded, and only extrinsic rewards are collected.

In order to reduce random fluctuations, a set of evaluation episodes (e.g., 10 or 20) is used at each interval, and the outcomes (e.g., returns, completion rates) are aggregated. For non-episodic tasks, a fixed horizon is imposed to standardize comparisons across intervals. The results are then summarized in learning curves, plotted against the cumulative training steps, for a clear depiction of changes in performance over the course of training.
